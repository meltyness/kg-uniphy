#C22-5 
Following from [[when all electric charge is at rest the surface of a conductor is always an equipotential surface]] (supposition A)

- In an electrostatic situation
- In a conductor with a cavity
- No charge present in the cavity
	- $\implies$ No net charge anywhere on the surface of the cavity.


To prove this, by contradiction
- Assume charge-free cavity
- Assume a [[voltage, or electric potential]] between a point on the surface and in the cavity
- Apply [[Gauss's law]] to a concentric surface in the charge-free cavity.
	- For the gaussian surface (following from the fact that the inner-surface must form an equipotential surface, but without knowing its charge, A)
	- With our voltage assumption, implies a flux across the gaussian surface, which would contradict the chargelessness of the cavity.
- This flux implies a charge in the cavity, which contradicts our assumptions, therefore $\vec{E} = 0$
	- [[principle of conservation of charge]] and [[Gauss's law]] describe where the [[net charge]] *does* go, to the outer surface.
