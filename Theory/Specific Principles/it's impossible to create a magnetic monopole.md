#WaitWhat if these always exist, but far from the motion? How would such a field source distribute in space
- i.e., some sort of "non-inverse" square law, with strength greatest tangential to motion
	- strength is at a maximum skew to the particle's direction of motion
	- everywhere uniform directionally
	- delayed by propagation
- how could it be occluded / how
