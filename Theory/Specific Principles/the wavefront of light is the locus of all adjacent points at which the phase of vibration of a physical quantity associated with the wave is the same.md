#C33-1 

This principle invokes [[tropographic]] [[vector field]], [[simple harmonic motion]], and the [[wave]] of course.

This also implies [[what causes motion, or causality|causality]], because in order to *describe* the phase imposes certain restrictions on how it could be measured from the source.

This also reads a bit like [[equipotential surfaces]], given we [[assume common, reasonable system geometry]] (though the word locus, is more generic and doesn't necessarily imply [[space]].)
