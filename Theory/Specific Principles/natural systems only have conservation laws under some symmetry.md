#C44-3 

#WaitWhat This is probably a degenerate statement of [[Noether's theorem]]

Clearer when analyzed in terms of [[Lagrangian formulation]].

> If a system is in an environment (i.e., [[externality]]) with spherical symmetry (i.e., [[field]]), there can be no torque acting on it, since this would be impossible under spherical symmetry, hence [[law of conservation of angular momentum]].

[[conservation]] is necessary and sufficient for [[axis symmetric]] transformations to exist.
