#C23-4 

Following from the assumption that we are talking about an [[electrostatic interactions]],

- [[in an electrostatic situation, the charge accumulates entirely on the surface of the conductor]]
- [[in electrostatics the electric field at every point within the material of a conductor must be zero]]
- [[for every electric field due to a static charge distribution, the force exerted by that field is conservative]]
- [[the electric field in an electrostatic Just outside of a conductor is always perpendicular]]

and serving as a definition for both a conductor in an electrostatic situation #WaitWhat ... don't we need to [[minimize the number of degrees of freedom in defining a physical quantity]]?
