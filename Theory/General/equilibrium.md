#### Discussion
This is so important it keeps [[facilities|buildings]] from toppling.

There are also two types, [[static equilibrium]] and [[dynamic equilibrium]], as permitted by [[Newton's first law of motion]]. The below definition pertains to [[static equilibrium]]

### ...of [[force]]
Based on [[Newton's first law of motion]], this is the case where $\sum \vec{F} = \vec{0}$ and $\vec{v} =\vec{c}$.

### ...of [[potential energy]]
#C7-5
Any minimum in a potential-energy curve is a stable equilibrium position.
- forces correct towards the stable equilibrium position

Any maximum in a potential-energy curve is an unstable equilibrium position.
- forces correct away from the unstable equilibrium position

A [[potential well]] exists between two points called [[turning points]] under a certain [[energy]] level.

Another [[states]] is neutral equilibrium, which means there is physical space in which the object will remain in equilibrium as opposed to a single point.

#### ... of [[rigid body]] / [[formula|in general]]
Beginning to generalize, a [[particle]] in an [[inertial frame of reference]] can't be in equilibrium unless both torques, and forces are both zero.

In addition to the force equilibrium condition,
- $\sum\vec{F}=\vec{0} \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \text{(first condition for equilibrium)}$ 

We must also have that [[torque]] is equal to zero, 
- $\sum\vec{\tau}=\vec{0} \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \text{(second condition for equilibrium)}$, 
 
when taken about *any* point.

#### ... of [[material phase]]
This exists where a material can exist in two or more phases simultaneously at a given [[thermodynamic state]].

#### ... of [[solid]] [[molecular motion]]
This is called $r_0$ in the [[heat capacity as a result of molecules#in a solid material system with monatomic molecule|heat capacity as a result of molecules#in a solid material system with monatomic molecule]]
