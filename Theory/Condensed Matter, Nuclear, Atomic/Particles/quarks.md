#C21-1 

A [[fermions]] and [[elementary particle]] with a charge of $$= \pm \frac{1}{3}e \ \ \ \ \ \ =\pm \frac{2}{3}e$$
The [[particle spin quantum number]] of the [[neutrons]] motivated these.

These are in turn held together by the [[gluon]]. They also come in three colors, red, blue, and green and every [[hadron]] contains exactly one of each. [[virtual subatomic particle|Virtual]] gluons provide [[exchange]] of [[quark color]]. The precise details are described by [[quantum chromodynamics]].
