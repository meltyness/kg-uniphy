#C44-3
There are three kinds $\pi^+, \pi^-, \pi^0$ 

#### $\pi^+, \pi^-$ [[antiparticle]] pair
$\pi^\pm$ have [[mass]] $m_\pi \approx 273m_e$, [[subatomic particle lifetime]] $t\approx 2.6\times10^{-8}$ 

undergoes [[charged pion decay]]

#### $\pi^0$
$\pi^0$ has [[mass]] $m_{\pi^0} \approx 264m_e$, [[subatomic particle lifetime]] $t\approx8.4\times10^{-17}$ 

undergoes [[neutral pion decay]]
