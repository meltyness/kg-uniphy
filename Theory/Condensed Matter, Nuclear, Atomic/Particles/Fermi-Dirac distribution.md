#C42-5 
For [[distinction, and indistinguishability|indistinguishable]] [[particle]], such as those represented by [[Schr√∂dinger equation]] or [[fermions]], when describing the [[states]] they may be in, $$f(E) = {1 \over e^{(E-E_F)/kT} + 1}$$
$E_F$ is the [[Fermi level]], a kind of [[expectation value]] where at $E_F$ half the states are filled, and half are empty, when this is independent of the temperature.

[[the Fermi level of semiconductors is dependent on temperature, but the Fermi level of metals is not]].

It is a [[complementary cumulative distribution function]]
