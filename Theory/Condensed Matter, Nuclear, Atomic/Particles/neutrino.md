An [[relativity|relativistic]] particle that occurs in [[law of beta particle decay and capture]]. Represented by greek character, "Nu" $$\nu$$
Closely related to the [[antineutrino]].

There's three, for each kind of [[lepton]]. [[hypotheses]]? [[subatomic particle lifetime]] is stable

| Neutrino | [[mass]] |
|-|-|
|$\nu_e$| $<3\times10^{-6} \text{ MeV/c}^2$|
|$\nu_\mu$| $<0.19 \text{ MeV/c}^2$|
|$\nu_\tau$| $<18.2 \text{ MeV/c}^2$|
