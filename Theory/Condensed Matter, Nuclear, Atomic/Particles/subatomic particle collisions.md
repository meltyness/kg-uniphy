#C25-1 

A kind of [[collision]] between [[subatomic particle]].

For example an [[electrons]] in a [[electrical conductivity, and resistivity|conductor]] [[material system]] collides with an [[electronic configuration, and ionization|ionized]] [[molecule]] in the [[metal]] and undergoes a [[random direction changes]]. 

Due to the forces causing the [[intermolecular long-range order]], and [[heat capacity as a result of molecules#in a solid material system with monatomic molecule|solid expression of heat and temperature]] these collisions can be modeled as turning the energy of the [[electric field]] into [[thermal energy]], so this can also be modeled as a form of [[energy transformation and heat flow]] which is applicable to [[heating coil]].

Also known as [[scattering]]

#WaitWhat does this define [[thermal contact, material system junction, optical junction or adventure|thermal contact]]? #GotIt ... yes, for a [[material system]].
