#C21-1 

Observed in a [[bubble-chamber]], this is an [[antiparticle]] produced in a pair with an electron, and necessitated by the [[Dirac equation]], where [[allow violation of common sense]] the production of a negative energy [[quantum states]] produced in [[electron-positron pair production]]

has a single positive [[elementary charge]], and the same [[mass]] as the [[electrons]].
