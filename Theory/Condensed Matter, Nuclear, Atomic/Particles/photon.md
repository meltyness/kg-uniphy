#C33-1 

The [[electromagnetic waves and light|light]] entity, as a [[subatomic particle]]. Has zero [[rest mass]] Light is emitted in [[quantum]]. 

#### ... and [[energy]]
In order to explain the [[photoelectric effect]], [[Albert Einstein]] gave the following relationship $$E=hf={hc \over \lambda}$$
which with the [[Planck constant]] gives the [[energy]] of a single photon.

#### ... and [[momentum]]
$$ p = {E \over c} = {hf \over c} = {h \over \lambda}$$

#### ... [[diffraction of light waves]] and [[elementary particle]] [[duality]] 
- Since apparently [[photon]] and [[electromagnetic waves and light]] are [[complementarity principle|complementary phenomena]], we reconsider the [[diffraction of light waves]] for photons
- We use a [[photocell, and photomultiplier]] which can detect individual photons, instead of using a [[screen]].
- By varying the detector position we find the density of detected photons varies with the intensity predicted in [[diffraction of light waves#phenomenology of a single occlude or filter slit|our analysis of a single slit]] producing a [[probability density]].
- However this isn't smooth like the intensity pattern we predicted, this is a phenomena that describes [[how often]] at each point we expect a detection.
- Applying the [[complementarity principle]]
	- The wave description describes the density, 
	- the particle description describes the interaction between individual photons at the photodetector
- Further questioning leads to 
	- Waves lead to interference patterns, patterns are built up by photons
	- Suppose we want to predict a [[phenomena of nature]] that involves both descriptions
	- [[quantum electrodynamics]] enables this [[synthesis]],


#### Applications
- [[emission spectra, absorption spectra and diffraction grating, spectroscopy]]
- [[photoelectric effect]]
- [[x-ray crystallography]]
	- #WaitWhat under [[Rayleigh scattering]], x-rays can gain energy?
