#C37-3 
An [[relativity|ultrarelativistic]], [[subatomic particle]] which come from [[stars]] and undergoes [[subatomic particle decay]] at $t_0\approx 2.20\times 10^{-6} \text{ s}$ when [[at rest]].

The first [[experiment or measurement]] regarding [[time dilation]].

Has [[electric charge]] equal to the [[elementary charge]]. 

Comes in two flavors $\mu^-, \mu^+$ with a [[mass]] $m\approx 207e_m$ 

It is [[particle spin quantum number]]-1/2, and hence a [[fermions]].

Undergoes [[muon decay]]
