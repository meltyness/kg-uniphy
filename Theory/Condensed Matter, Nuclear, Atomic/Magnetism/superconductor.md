#C25-2 

A [[material phase]] in which [[subatomic particle collisions]] apparently cease between the [[elementary entities]] involved in [[electrical current]], and the [[electrical conductivity, and resistivity|resistivity]] drops to zero.

#WaitWhat doesn't this violate [[the Carnot cycle]] efficiency limits?

#### ... superconductor properties in Type-I
- Superconduction starts
	- Critical [[temperature]] at extreme [[pressure]], $14^\circ \text{ C}$ claimed for [[carbonaceous sulfur hydride]]
- Superconduction reversed (or prevented)
	- Critical [[current density]]
	- Critical [[magnetic field]]
- [[persistent current]] following [[electromagnetic induction]].
- [[Meissner effect in a superconductor]]
- Strong [[diamagnetism]]
	- Exhibits [[repulsion]] with a [[permanent magnet, ferromagnetic material]]

#### ... superconductor properties in Type-II
- Develop [[filament|filamentations]] of [[magnetic field]] when exposed.
- Typically have much higher $B_c$.
	- Actually have two critical fields value, one for the filamentation, one for the transition back to normal.

#### ... in terms of [[lattice electronic energy]]
- The [[Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory of superconduction]] describes this [[phenomena of nature]] in terms of the [[quantum mechanics]]. Though it remains a [[hypotheses]].

#### ... applications
- [[measurement device]]
- [[alternator]]
- [[electrical power transmission]]
- [[health and safety]]
