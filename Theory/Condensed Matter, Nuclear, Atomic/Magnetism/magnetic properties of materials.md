#C27-7 

- [[permanent magnet, ferromagnetic material]]
- Generally a product of [[electronic configuration, and ionization]]
	- [[nucleus]] [[particle spin quantum number]]
	- and [[electrons]] [[particle spin quantum number]]

#### ... the [[Bohr magneton]]
Using the [[Bohr model of the atom]] to approximate the orbitals, we can compute a [[magnetic moment]] due to the motion of the [[electrons]] around the [[nucleus]]. 

Signified $\mu_B$.

This is a distinct source of moment from [[particle spin quantum number]].

#### ... in [[paramagnetism]]
A paramagnetic material is one capable of [[magnetization density|magnetization]], and its [[elementary entities]] align to produce a [[magnetic dipole]] with the [[magnetic field]]. It has [[relative permeability]] $K_m > 1$, and is susceptible to [[temperature]].

#### ... in [[diamagnetism]]
A paramagnetic material is one which opposes an incident [[magnetic field]], it has [[relative permeability]], $K_m < 1$.

#### ... in [[permanent magnet, ferromagnetic material|ferromagnetism]]
This common case is what is typically called a [[permanent magnet, ferromagnetic material]], $K_m \approx 10^3-10^5$

#### ... in a [[superconductor]]
A [[material phase]] where the [[subatomic particle collisions]] which cause [[electrical conductivity, and resistivity|resisitivity]] are [[frozen out]] due to [[quantum]] effects.

#### Applications
- [[disks, and information media]] 
- [[solenoid, and current loops#with a permanent magnet ferromagnetic material ferromagnetic core]]
- [[electric motor]]
- [[electrical transformers]]
