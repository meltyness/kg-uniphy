#C28-8 

In an [[atom]] most orbital, spin effects wind up at zero, or occasionally at $\mu_B$. When a [[material system]] with $\mu_B$ is placed in a [[magnetic field]], each such moment see $$\vec{\tau}=\vec{\mu}_B \times \vec{B}$$ and will tend to align to the magnetic moment in the field, to minimize $U=-\vec{\mu}\cdot\vec{B}$ [[motion of charges in a magnetic field#as a torque on a electrical conductivity and resistivity conductor loop magnetic dipole|dipole potential energy]], and in doing so contribute to $\vec{B}$ locally. 

Similar to the [[solenoid, and current loops#a solenoid and current loops in terms of the magnetic dipole|we can write the magnetic field of a current loop in terms of its magnetic dipole moment]] we can produce a [[magnetization density]] vector from this we find$$\vec{M} = {\vec{\mu}_\text{total} \over V}$$
and the additional field due to the magnetization #ProofDeferred is $\mu_0\vec{M}$, so in total, $$\vec{B} = \vec{B}_0 +\mu_0 \vec{M}$$
With this we define three exciting new [[physical quantities]],
- [[relative permeability]]:  with $K_m \approx 1.00001\text{ to }1.003$
- [[permeability]]: $\mu=K_m\mu_0$ #Caution  this symbol overrides [[magnetic moment]].
- [[magnetic susceptibility]]: $\chi_m = K_m - 1$ which varies inversely with [[temperature]], because [[random motion]] thwarts the [[magnetic order]] needed.
- [[Curie's law]] gives the relationship between susceptibility and temperature.

Additionally $M \rightarrow M_\text{sat}$ but only at very low temperature, such as $T \approx 1 \text{ K}$.
