A [[hypotheses]] regarding the [[phenomenology]] of a [[superconductor]].
- [[Cooper pairs]] form as an interaction between [[conduction energy band]] [[electrons]] due to [[electronic configuration, and ionization|positively-charged ions]] in the [[crystal]].
	- An electron with a [[momentum]] interacts with the ion, and their [[displacement]] decreases.
	- Another electron with opposite momentum is then attracted.
	- This produces a [[conduction energy band]]
