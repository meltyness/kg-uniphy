#WaitWhat  (possibly) Named for Manisia, Turkey (Magnesia) circa 500 B.C. for iron fragments.

A [[electrical properties of materials]] where the [[electronic configuration, and ionization]] results in a [[magnetic field]] around the [[material system]].

#### ... [[magnetic properties of materials]]
This includes many [[metal]] and [[alloy]] such as [[iron]], [[nickel]], [[cobalt]]. 

Atomic [[magnetic moment]] interact and align into [[magnetic domains]], even in the absence of an external [[magnetic field]]. These [[crystal]] materials. Many $\approx 10^3$ [[Bohr magneton|magnetons]] appear in each domain. This gives ferromagnetic materials a [[relative permeability]] $K_m \approx 10^3 \text{ to } 10^5$.

The [[magnetization density]] approaches a $M_\text{sat}$ where no further moments are formed.

This slightly increases magnetization once the field is removed as well, [[magnetic hysteresis]], and during this [[thermodynamic process, path]], the [[temperature]] increases. [[iron]] is a good choice for [[solenoid, and current loops#with a permanent magnet ferromagnetic material ferromagnetic core|solenoid cores]].

Typical values #ThumbRule is that these materials will relax to $\approx 1 \text{ T}$. corresponding to $M=B/\mu_0$.

An interesting result which follows from [[magnetic dipole#definition and formula|magnetic dipole potential energy]], and [[law of conservation of angular momentum]] as with [[solenoid, and current loops|current loops]] is called the [[Einstein-de Haas effect]]

#### ... [[earth, atmosphere, water, and wildlife]]
The earth has a permanent magnetic field, it is not aligned with the [[axis]] of [[kinematics of rotational motion of rigid bodies|rotation]], nor the surface. The deviations are respectively called the variation, and inclincation. $\approx 30 \text{ mT}$

#### ... [[magnetization density]]
When brought into contact with a magnet, [[solid]] [[iron]] becomes magnetized. This relationship is not, in general, linear with $B$.

#### ... basic [[explanation|description]]
A permanent magnet has two [[poles]] (a bit like a [[dipole moment]]). [[it's impossible to create a magnetic monopole]].

When broken in half, you wind up with two magnetic [[material system]], and four poles.

#### ... caused by [[electrons]]
Ferromagnetism results from [[particle spin quantum number]], of the electrons. In a chunk of magnetized [[iron]], the spin of the electrons begins to come into alignment, a bit like how [[degrees of freedom]] in the [[intramolecular motion#in a diatomic ideal gas]] has it such that only one rotational mode except at [[temperature]] extremes.

Raising [[temperature]] can eliminate this [[magnetic order]], as well as [[mechanical waves]] through the [[material system]]. 

Generally these are called [[magnetic properties of materials]].

#### Applications
- Part of a [[magnetic compass]], [[solenoid, and current loops]], [[brushed DC motor]]
