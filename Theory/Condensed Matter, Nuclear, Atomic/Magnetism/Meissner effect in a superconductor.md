#C29-8

- A [[material system]] undergoes a [[material phase change]] to [[superconductor]] while it is is placed in $\vec{B}_0$ [[magnetic field]], which at the transition temperature is lower than the critical field
	- $\vec{B}= \vec{0}$ inside the superconductor
	- Just outside the superconductor the [[magnetic field lines]] are **nearly** [[tangent]] to the surface of the [[material system]] (possibly a few hundred [[atom]] thick layer are still [[submersion|in the field]])
	- With a [[solenoid, and current loops|coil]] taut around the object, during the transition it is observed that that $$\Delta \Phi_B = -\Phi_{Bi}$$ as measured [[Faraday's law of induction|utilizing]] $\mathcal{E} = {-d\Phi_B \over dt}$ and a [[d'Arsonval galvanometer]]
	- And if we eliminate $\vec{B}_0$ no further changes are observed through the coil.
