#C28-8 

With the discussion of [[paramagnetism]] fresh in mind, $\chi_m$ provides a clear distinction between paramagnetic and diamagnetic materials, $\chi_m < 0$ in diamagnetism, so the field opposes, rather than contributes to the external incident [[magnetic field]]. The law obeyed is [[Faraday's law of induction]]. [[An induced electric current always tends to cancel the field change that caused it]].

This phenomena is temperature-independent.

The further out the [[electronic configuration, and ionization|valence shells]] the [[electrons]] are the more likely they are to go towards [[motion of charges in a magnetic field]], which produces a [[magnetic field]] opposing the incident one.
