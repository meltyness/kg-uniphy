[[nucleus|Nuclei]] are subject to different kinds of [[task]] [[state change|transformations]], subject to 
- [[principle of conservation of charge]]
- [[law of conservation of energy]]
- [[law of conservation of momentum]]
- [[law of conservation of angular momentum]]
- [[law of conservation of nucleons]]

#### [[nuclear transmutation]]
First [[experiment or measurement]] by [[Ernest Rutherford]], $${}^{14}\text{N}+\alpha\rightarrow{}_8^{17}\text{O}+{}_1^1\text{H}$$
#### [[nuclear reaction energy]]
If a reaction like $A+B\rightarrow C+D$, then following from [[mass-energy equivalence]], this is $$Q=(M_A+M_B-M_C-M_D)c^2$$
In an [[endoergic nuclear reaction]], there is a threshold energy, below which reactions don't "go". 

Applying [[law of conservation of momentum]], we have that #WaitWhat #ProofDeferred $$K_\text{cm} = {M \over M+m}K$$
In order for [[nucleons]] to penetrate the [[electromagnetic interaction]], it can either
- Have $K>U$
- Undergo [[quantum tunneling]] following [[Fermi-Dirac distribution]]

#### [[neutron absorption]]
A process by which heavy [[nucleus]] with $Z>92$ are bombarded with [[neutrons]], and alternate between absorption and [[law of beta particle decay and capture|beta decay]].

#### [[nuclear fusion]]
Two light nuclei form a larger nucleus.

#### [[nuclear fission]], [[nuclear spallation]]
A large [[nucleus]] turns into smaller [[atomic speciation, nuclides, isotope|species]].

#### [[nuclear decay]]
This is described via a [[Segrè chart]], for each [[atomic speciation, nuclides, isotope]].

##### [[alpha particles]]
This is produced under the [[law of alpha particle decay]]

##### [[beta particles]]
This is produced under the [[law of beta particle decay and capture]] $$\text{n} \rightarrow p + \beta^- +\bar{v}_e$$
##### [[gamma]] [[photon]]
The nucleus has [[nuclear excited states]] that can perform [[energy storage and transmission]]. This is produced under the [[law of gamma decay]]. Basically a statement regarding the 

##### [[radioactivity]]
Many [[element]] and [[material system]] exhibit [[nuclear lifetime]]. 

A [[Segrè chart]] shows allowable and possible modes of decay between [[element]] and [[atomic speciation, nuclides, isotope]].
