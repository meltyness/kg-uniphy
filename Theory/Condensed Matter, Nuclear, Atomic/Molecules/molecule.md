#C16-2 
From [[Chemistry]], a familiar concept.

- The smallest is a single [[atom]] on the order of $10^{-10} \text{ m}$ in [[length]]
- Larger molecules can be more than $10,000\times$ larger (such as [[polymers]] or [[proteins]])
- Has a [[molar mass]] depending on the [[chemical formula]]
- May be considered to be [[molecules are always in motion|always in motion]]
- Undergo [[chemical and molecular bonding]]

#### ... under [[emission spectra, absorption spectra and diffraction grating, spectroscopy]] and [[spectroscopy]] for [[diatomic]] molecules
##### [[phenomenology]]
- For a diatomic molecule separated by $r_0$, based on the [[molecular geometry]] and [[bond radius]], $$E={L^2 \over 2I}$$
- Energy is still [[quantum]] and following the [[Schr√∂dinger equation]], $$E_l=l(l+1){\hbar^2 \over 2I}$$
- Taking the [[reduced mass]], $$I=m_rr_0^2$$
- And for [[diatomic vibration]] $$E_n(n+\frac{1}{2})\hbar\omega=(n+\frac{1}{2})\hbar\sqrt{k' \over m_r} \ \ \ \ \ (n=0,1,2\dots)$$
- with $\Delta E=\hbar\omega = \hbar\sqrt{k'/m_r}$ 
- and there combined energy is simply added.
- They adhere to [[quantum selection rules]], Upon [[heat radiation and absorption, thermal radiation]], of a [[photon]], about the ground state, $$\Delta n =\pm1 \ \ \ \ \ \  \text{ simultaneously, }\ \ \ \ \ \ \Delta l = \pm1$$
- Such modes are responsible for [[global climate change]].
