#C16-2 

A type of [[random motion]] within a [[volume]] of [[molecule|molecules]], where their average [[displacement]] is [[abstract negligible facets|large compared to]] the [[nucleus]] dimension. Lots of jerks call this [[kinetic theory]]. 

[[molecules are always in motion]], even at [[absolute zero]]

#### ... in general
##### ... from [[statistical mechanics]]
These are considered under [[principle of equipartition of energy]], with a certain number of [[degrees of freedom]].

##### ... [[molecular speeds]]
This may be [[impossible]] to [[experiment or measurement|measure precisely]]

##### ... [[molecular diffusion]]
The type of motion experienced between containers

##### ... [[Rayleigh scattering]]
Molecules act as an [[communications antenna|antenna]] for a specific [[electromagnetic spectrum, frequency of light]] when participating in [[law of light transmission, and refraction|light transmission]].

### ... in a [[gas]]
##### ... [[ideal gas law]]
This assumes the effect of [[intermolecular and interatomic forces]], [[elastic collision|elastic collisions]] are negligible.

##### ... [[van der Waals equation]]
... [[assign a heuristic coefficient|assigns a heuristic coefficient]] for certain effects

##### ... [[gas as point particles]]
Relates the [[equation of thermodynamic state]] with [[molecular speeds]].

##### ... [[gas as spatial particles]]
Assumes [[definite size and a definite shape]] of each [[molecule]].

### ...[[intermolecular and interatomic forces]]
[[what causes motion, or causality]] for a [[molecule]] in a [[material system]].

##### ... [[intramolecular forces]]
Give rise to [[intramolecular motion]]

#### ... in a [[fluid]]
##### [[intermolecular short-range order]]
Presumably this gives rise to other effects of fluids

#### ... in a [[solid]]
##### ... [[heat capacity as a result of molecules|spring force model of heat capacity]]
An approximation of the molecular motion of solids predicts their heat capacity

##### ... [[intermolecular long-range order]]
Presumably more precise effects result in this
