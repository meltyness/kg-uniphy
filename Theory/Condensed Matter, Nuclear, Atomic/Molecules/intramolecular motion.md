[[statistical mechanics]] leads to the following important results
- [[principle of equipartition of energy]]
- [[degrees of freedom]] 

#### ... in a [[monatomic]] [[ideal gas]]
In the scope of intramolecular motion, for a [[monatomic]] gas, the number of [[velocity]] [[scalar quantity|components]] needed to completely describe the motion. 

So for [[gas as point particles]], $v_x, v_y, v_z$ gives each particle $E[K]=3(\frac{1}{2}kT)$ #WaitWhat  is this [[circular logic]]?
- Reiterating [[heat capacity as a result of molecules#derivation of formula for each molecule|this argument]]
- From [[Boltzmann constant]] $N_Ak=R$
- From [[average]] definition, $K_\text{total}=nN_A(\frac{3}{2}kT)$
- From [[heat capacity and specific heat#molar mass using moles for heat capacity|molar heat capacity]], $C_V={\frac{1}{n}}{\partial Q \over \partial T}$
- Combining the **total energy** with the molar capacity, $C_V = \frac{1}{n}\frac{\partial Q}{\partial T}=\frac{1}{n}\frac{K_\text{total}}{T}=\frac{3}{2}N_Ak$ 

$$C_V=3\bigg(\frac{1}{2}kT\bigg)=\frac{3}{2}R \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \text{(monatomic ideal gas)}$$

#### ... in a [[diatomic]] [[ideal gas]]
For diatomic molecules, the [[nucleus|nuclei]] are attached through [[intramolecular forces]]. 
- 3 DOF to [[position]]
- 1 DOF to [[angle]] #Caution not universally , but as a meaningful thought experiment, consider why the molecules in [diatomic gases may organize themselves into angular-momentum polarity](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0022-3700/10/4/025/meta)
- 1 DOF to [[diatomic vibration]] #Caution not a universal claim though.
- Following from a similar argument following from $E[K]$:
$$C_V = 5(\frac{1}{2}kT) = \frac{5}{2}R\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \  \text{(diatomic ideal gas)}$$
