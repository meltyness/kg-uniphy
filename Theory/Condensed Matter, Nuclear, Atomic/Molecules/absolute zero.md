#C17-3 

Zero [[kelvin]], in some sense a [[speed limit]] since it can only be [[experiment or measurement]] to a close approximation.

A [[material system]] in this [[thermodynamic state]] has the **minimum possible** amount of [[total mechanical energy]] / [[Lagrangian]]. 

Due to [[quantum]] effects, #Caution  it is **not** correct to say that all [[molecular motion]] ceases.
