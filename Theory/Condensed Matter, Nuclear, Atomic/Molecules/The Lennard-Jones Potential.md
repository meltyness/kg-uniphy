#C18-E 

This is a [[potential energy]] [[formula]] for the [[van der Waals interaction]] between two [[molecule]]. 

By #20thCentury [[physicists]] [[John Lennard-Jones]]
$$U(r)=U_0\bigg[\bigg({R_0 \over r}\bigg)^{12} - 2\bigg({R_0 \over r}\bigg)^6 \ \bigg]$$
Relates the 
- strongly repulsive [[occlude or filter|occlusive?]] [[Pauli force]]
