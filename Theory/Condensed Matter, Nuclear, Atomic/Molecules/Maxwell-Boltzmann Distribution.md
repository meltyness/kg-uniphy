#C18-5 

A [[describe outcomes|result]] from [[statistical mechanics]], which provides the [[probability density]] of [[molecular speeds]] $$f(v)=4\pi\bigg({m\over 2\pi kT}\bigg)^{3/2}v^2e^{-mv^2/2kT}$$
- This can be used to take on [[evaporation]]
- This can be used to take on [[activation energy]]
- This assumes that the objects are [[distinction, and indistinguishability|distinguishable]]
