#C16-2 

In a [[kind of material]] which is a [[material compound]], there are [[molecule]] in [[molecular motion]] due to the [[temperature]] and [[thermal energy]]. 

This is closely related to the [[speed of sound]] in that material, especially for a [[gas]] as derived in the [[dynamics of a sound wave]].

##### ...as a [[probability density]]
See the [[molecular beam regulator|theory of operation for a molecular beam regulator]]

#### ... as [[Maxwell-Boltzmann Distribution]]

##### ...as an [[average]], and a [[root-mean square]]
In addition to the [[thermal energy]] relating to the [[kinetic energy]] as developed in [[the translational kinetic energy per molecule in an ideal gas depends only on temperature]] $$\frac{1}{2}mE[v^2]=\frac{3}{2}kT$$
We also want to write the [[root-mean square]] for a [[material system]], $$v_\text{rms} = \sqrt{E[v^2]}=\sqrt{3kT \over m}=\sqrt{3RT \over M}$$
Which varies inversely with [[molar mass]]. This implies too that at the [[atmosphere]], some [[specimen]] reach [[escape speed]]. [[the concentration of hydrogen in the atmosphere is low because it is buoyant, and can easily reach escape speed]]
