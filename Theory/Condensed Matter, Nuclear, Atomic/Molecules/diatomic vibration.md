#C18-4 

This [[degrees of freedom]] does **not** contribute to [[heat capacity and specific heat]] effectively, due to [[quantum mechanics]]:

- [[kinetic energy]] due to such motion is [[quantum|quantized]], can only change in finite steps -- there is a "first step" whereby there is no motion
- Call this step size $\Delta E$ (from a [Quantum harmonic oscillator - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_harmonic_oscillator))
- If $\Delta E >> {K_\text{tr} \over N}=\frac{1}{2}mE[v^2]$ recalling that we can write [[gas as point particles]]
- Then, [[how often]] [[molecule]] will take on such a motion will be very low.
- Therefore changing [[temperature]] does not change [[intramolecular motion|vibrational intramolecular motion]]

The step size is smaller for [[intramolecular motion|rotation]], or [[intramolecular motion|speed]], so those are preferred, or more likely.

These [[degrees of freedom]] are [[frozen out]].
