#C42-1

#### Ionic bonds
These form between [[electronic configuration, and ionization|ionized]] [[atom]], where a donor [[valence shell]] and the recipient interact to form a new joint [[electron shell level, or orbit]]. This requires overcoming the [[electronic configuration, and ionization#... ionization energy|ionization energy]] of the donor.

#### Covalent bonds
These form between the [[electron shell level, or orbit]] where the [[particle spin quantum number]] have opposite [[polarity]].

#### [[van der Waals interaction]] bonds
These form between the [[electrical dipole]] of two [[molecule]] such as [[material phase change]] of [[condensing]] [[hydrogen]] as $\text{H}_2$ or in [[surface tension]] exhibited by [[fluid]] [[water]].

#### [[hydrogen]] bonds
Hydrogen appears as an [[electrons]] donor between two other [[atom]].

#### [[metallic bonding]]
This is an additional type of covalent bonds form in [[diamond]], [[germanium]], [[silicon]], as well as in [[metallic bonding]] which leads to the [[lattice electronic energy]].
