#C13-4 

An [[intermolecular and interatomic forces]] [[force]], likely the cause of macroscopic [[contact force]]. Largely responsible for [[chemical and molecular bonding]] and mediated by [[electromagnetic interaction]].

Has [[formula]] following from [[simple harmonic motion#atom vibrations in material|simple harmonic motion of atoms in solids]]

$$F_r = {-dU \over dr} = U_0[{12R_0^{12} \over r^13}-2{6R_0^6\over r^7}]={12U_0\over R_0}[({R_0\over r})^{13}-({R_0\over r})^7]$$
