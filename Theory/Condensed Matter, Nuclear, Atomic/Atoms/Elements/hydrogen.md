A key [[atomic speciation, nuclides, isotope]] / [[electronic configuration, and ionization]] is called a [[deuteron]].

#### ... an analysis of the [[atom]] using the [[Schr√∂dinger equation]], and [[quantum mechanics]]
- Facets of the [[electronic configuration, and ionization]] of a given [[nucleus]] can be performed.
- This type of analysis presents important consideration with respect to [[electron energy level]], and aspects of [[chemical reaction]] that occur.
- We also note that we use the [[reduced mass]] as described for the [[center of mass]] of the [[atom]].
- We use [[Coulomb's law]] to describe the [[potential energy]] in the system $$U(r)={-1 \over 4\pi\epsilon_0}{e^2 \over r}$$
- Gives #ProofDeferred $$E_n={-1 \over (4\pi\epsilon_0)^2}{m_re^4 \over 2n^2\hbar^2}={-13.60 \text{ eV} \over n^2}$$
	- $n$ is called the [[principal quantum number]], corresponding to the [[electron shell level, or orbit]]
- There is also an [[orbital quantum number]] $$L=\sqrt{l(l+1)}\hbar \ \ \ \ \ (l=0,1,2,\dots,n-1)$$
- and there is also the [[magnetic quantum number]] $$L_z=m_l\hbar \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (m_l=0,\pm1,\pm2,\dots,\pm l)$$
- With the [[probability density]], $$P(r) \ dt = |\psi|^2\ dV=|\psi|^24\pi r^2 \ dr$$
- Distance of these shells is often written in terms of the [[Bohr model of the atom]], and the smallest predicted orbital, $r/a$ $$a={\epsilon_0 h^2 \over \pi m_r e^2}={4\pi\epsilon_0\hbar^2 \over m_r e^2}\approx5.29\times10^{-11} \text{ m}$$
