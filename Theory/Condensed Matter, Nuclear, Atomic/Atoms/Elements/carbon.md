#### Effective [[material phase subspeciation, allotropy, polymorphism, and hysteresis]]
- For [[carbon]], as an example, there exists a [[material phase]] where the [[material]] is [[soot]], and is [[order and disorder|disorganized]] or [[diamond]] where it is a [[solid]] [[crystal]].
- Another example [[buckminsterfullerene]] generated in this experiment:
