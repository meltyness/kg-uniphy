>The only [[impossible|possible]] [[gas]] [[material phase]] [[atomic speciation, nuclides, isotope]] of uranium is when it is [[intramolecular forces|bonded]] with [[fluoride]]

Due to [[mass-energy equivalence]] one of the most [[energy]] [[density|dense]] [[kind of material]] on [[earth, atmosphere, water, and wildlife]].

With [[chemical formula]] $$\text{UF}_6$$A process called [[gaseous diffusion processing of uranium]] is used to separate different [[atomic speciation, nuclides, isotope|isotopes]] of the substance.

In this image of ${}^{235}\text{U}$ you can see possible signs of [[cavitation]], this is refined uranium suitable for [[nuclear fission]] and [[nuclear fusion]].
