#C17-4 

A single unit of a [[material]]. Composed of [[subatomic particle]].

- The [[atom]] diameter on the order of $10^{-10} \text{ m}$ in [[length]]
- A matching number of [[electrons]]
	- With an [[electronic configuration, and ionization]]
- [[magnetic field|Magnetic fields]] on the order of $10 \text{ T}$ [[tesla]] are important for [[emission spectra, absorption spectra and diffraction grating, spectroscopy]]
- The [[nucleus]] $\approx 10^{-15} \text{ m}$ in length following from [[Ernest Rutherford]]
	- [[atomic speciation, nuclides, isotope]]
- [[reduced mass]]

#### ... the [[electronic configuration, and ionization]]
Atoms are composed of the [[nucleus]] and the [[electrons]] as configured.

#### ... the [[Bohr model of the atom]]
Treats the structure as an [[analogy]] to [[Kepler's laws]].

#### ... and the [[nucleus]]
Following
- [[Milliken oil drops]], [[electron e-m ratio]], it was demonstrated that [[electrons]] alone could not explain the [[mass]] of most [[material system]].
- Other proposals
	- The orbital atom
	- The ephemeral atom
- [[Rutherford scattering]]
