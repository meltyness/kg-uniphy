#C43-1
Center of the [[atom]], [[protons]] and [[neutrons]] held together by [[strong interaction]] and [[semi-empirical nuclear model|formed]] by the [[weak interaction]].

The [[radius]] of a [[uranium]] nucleus is on the order of $7.4\times 10^{-15} \text{ m}$

[[Ernest Rutherford]] discovered that large nuclei can be [[experiment or measurement|observed]] to undergo [[disintegration]] to produce [[radioactivity]].

#### [[nuclear reactions]]
The gain, loss, or modification of [[subatomic particle]].

#### ... [[nuclear binding]], and [[strong interaction]] [[formula]] [[derivation]]
- The nucleus is an [[equilibrium]] system.
- Separated the [[protons]] and [[neutrons]] have [[rest mass]] $E_0$
- The [[self-energy|process of separating them]] requires adding energy $E_B$ the [[nuclear binding]] [[energy]]
- Then the energy of the system is $E_0-E_B$
- The [[mass]] of the nucleus is less than the constituents by $E_B/c^2$ called the [[nuclear mass defect]]
- Following from [[mass-energy equivalence]], 
$$E_B=(ZM_H+Nm_n-{{}^A_Z\text{M}})c^2$$
- This binding energy varies from
	- [[deuteron]], ${}_1^2\text{H}$ with $E_B=2.224\text{ MeV}$
	- [[nickel]], ${}_{28}^{62}\text{Ni}$ with $E_B=545.3\text{ MeV}$
	- On average, $E_B \approx 7-9\text{ MeV}$
- This [[potential energy]] is a result of the [[strong interaction]], a [[fundamental forces|force]] of [[attraction]]
- It operates with a range $r = \mathcal{O}(10^{-15} \text{ m})$


#### [[atomic speciation, nuclides, isotope]]
This feature of [[atom]] is explained by interactions of the [[nucleus]]

For a specific [[atom]] [[specimen]], this is represented with [[AZE notation]] $$\huge {{}^A_Z\text{E}}$$
Where
- $A$ Is the number of [[mass number]], the number of [[protons]],[[neutrons]] in the [[nucleus]].
- $Z$ is the [[archaic|(archaic? archaic.)]] [[atomic number]] (same thing as the element)
- $E$ is the name of the [[element]].

#### [[particle spin quantum number]]
[[protons]] and [[neutrons]] are [[fermions|spin 1/2 particles]], so that $$S=\sqrt{\frac{1}{2}\bigg(\frac{1}{2} + 1\bigg)\hbar}=\sqrt{3 \over 4}\hbar$$
and $$S_z = \pm{\hbar\over 2}$$
... and we define the total [[angular momentum]] of the nucleus with $\vec{J}=\sum_n \vec{L}_i+\vec{S}_i$ over the $n$ [[protons]] and [[neutrons]], and both their [[particle spin quantum number]], [[magnetic quantum number]]-related momentum, then $J=\sqrt{j(j+1)\hbar}$ and $$J_z=m_j\hbar \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (m_j=-j,-j+1,\dots,j-1,j)$$ where $j$ is the [[nuclear spin quantum number]], and associated [[magnetic moment]], for a single [[nuclear magneton]] $$\mu_n={e\hbar \over 2m_p}=5.05078\times10^{-27}\text{ J/T}=3.15245\times10^{-8}\text{ eV/T}$$
and $$|\mu_\text{sz}|_\text{proton} = 2.7928\mu_n \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ |\mu_\text{sz}|_\text{neutron} = 1.9130\mu_n$$
which [[identify anomalous attributes|suggests some substructure]] which leads to [[quarks]].

Then the total magnetic moment $\mathcal{O}(10)\mu_n$. This can be measured with [[spectroscopy]] and results in [[hyperfine structure]], as in [[the Zeeman effect]].

#### Applications
- [[Magnetic resonance imaging]]
- [[nuclear magnetic resonance]]
- [[Stern-Gerlach experiment]], and [[spectroscopy]]
