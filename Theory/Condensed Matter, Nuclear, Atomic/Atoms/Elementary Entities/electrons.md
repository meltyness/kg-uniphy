#C1-1 

[[electromagnetic interaction|electrical]] [[particle|entity]]. Discovered as a separate entity by [[J. J. Thomson]]

[Geon (physics) - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geon_(physics)) "coined the term as a contraction of "gravitational electromagnetic entity"

Has [[mass]] $$\text{m}=9.1093826(16)\times 10^{-31} \text{ kg}$$
as determined by [[J. J. Thomson]] in the #19thCentury with a [[subatomic particle accelerators]], which determined the [[electron e-m ratio]]

and charge $$ -\text{e} $$
the [[elementary charge]], measured in [[Milliken oil drops]].

Has [[particle spin quantum number]], which produces a [[magnetic field]], and [[magnetic moment]].
