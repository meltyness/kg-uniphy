[[quantum mechanics]] effect.

Demonstrated by use of the [[Stern-Gerlach experiment]], and the appearance of non-even bands of atoms, as predicted by $m_l$ from the [[Schr√∂dinger equation]].

The [[magnetic moment]] associated is then $$\mu_z = -(2.00232){e \over 2m_e}S_z$$
for a particular $S_z=m_s\hbar$.
