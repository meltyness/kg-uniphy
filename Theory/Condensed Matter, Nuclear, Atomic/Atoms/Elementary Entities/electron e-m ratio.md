#C27-5 
[[J. J. Thomson]] carried out this [[experiment or measurement]] in the #19thCentury.

Exposing [[electrons]] from a [[cathode ray tube]] to a known [[voltage, or electric potential]] gives the [[formula]] $$\frac{1}{2}mv^2 = eV$$
With a filter acting as a [[control grid, velocity selector]], we have $v=E/B$. $${e \over m} = {E^2 \over 2VB^2}$$
$$\text{e/m} = 1.75882012(15) \times 10^{11}\text{ C / kg}$$


Another method is throug the [[Tolman-Stewart experiment]].
