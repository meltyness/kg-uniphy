#C42-5

A model of [[electrical conductivity, and resistivity]] under [[metallic bonding]].

#### ... [[conduction energy band]]
In a [[crystal]] with $N$ [[atom]] that are [[abstract negligible facets|not interacting]] under, $d\rightarrow\infty$ excluding, for example [[heat capacity as a result of molecules|spring force model of heat capacity]], but also any [[chemical and molecular bonding]] each atom has the same [[electronic configuration, and ionization]], except that by [[Pauli exclusion principle]] there are then $N$ nearly-identical states, except for the identity of the associated atom.

If we decrease the [[displacement]] $d$ of all the atoms, then the [[wavefunction]] of the [[valence shell]] [[electrons]] distort and their [[equiprobable surfaces]] form a continuum around the [[crystal]]. 

Since $N$ is $\mathcal{O}(N_A)$, we can effectively treat the *valence* [[electron energy level]] dispersion as [[assuming everything is continuous|continuous]]. While the core energy levels are not effected, depending on the [[kind of material]], [[atomic group]], [[periodic table]], and [[crystal#Non-idealities]].

#### ... [[energy band structure]] [[phenomenology]]
We can use this to predict the behavior of [[dielectric, and dielectric strength]], [[electrical conductivity, and resistivity]], and [[semiconductors]]

- [[conduction energy band]]
	- [[electrons]] [[density]] increases with

		- [[magnetic field]]
	- There exists free [[quantum states]].
- [[valence energy band]] 
	- Source of [[electric hole]] [[current density]], [[intermolecular long-range order]]
- [[electron shell screening]], [[structural energy band]]
	- Source of [[law of electric attraction and repulsion|repulsion]], produces limitations on [[molecular radius]], [[molecular geometry]], and the shape of the [[crystal]].
- [[semiconductors]] and their various ways to be built.
