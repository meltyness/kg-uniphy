#C27-2 

A [[measurement device]] to measure the [[electromagnetic spectrum, frequency of light]] and therefore facets of the [[electronic configuration, and ionization]] of an [[atom]], which is caused by facets of the [[magnetic field]] of the [[atom]], [[nucleus]] influence these, aid predicting them. #ProofDeferred .

Under [[combustion]] or [[electronic configuration, and ionization|ionization]] many [[gas]] [[material system]] give off "sharp" spectral lines when passed through a diffraction grating, which refers to its emission spectra, a fundamental experiment demonstrating the [[quantum]] nature of [[photon]], and [[electronic configuration, and ionization]].

Additionally when [[natural light, and continuous spectra]] is [[incident]] onto a [[material system]] it can be expecteed to absorb some very specific parts of the [[electromagnetic spectrum, frequency of light]] following from the [[tropographic]] nature of its [[electronic configuration, and ionization]].

#### [[phenomenology]]
- Following from $N$-slit [[diffraction of light waves#formula derivation|diffraction]], [[light intensity]] peaks in the [[interference of light waves|interference]] pattern that grow narrower with $N$.
- It follows that due to the [[fringe density]] and the relationships that maxima occur at $$d\sin\theta = m\lambda \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (m=0,\pm1,\pm2\dots)$$
- We can measure the [[electromagnetic spectrum, frequency of light|light]] [[wavelength]].

#### [[formula]] [[derivation]]
- Assuming [[Fresnel and Fraunhofer diffraction|Fraunhofer, far-field diffraction]] from [[incident]] [[electromagnetic waves and light|plane waves]]
	- Grates spaced at $d$
	- A [[optical lens]] concentrates the parallel filtered waves.
- It follows that due to the [[fringe density]] and the relationships, $$d\sin\theta = m\lambda \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (m=0,\pm1,\pm2\dots)$$
- Which implies that for larger wavelengths, a greater deflection of the maxima occurs shorter wavelengths are deflected less.
- If the grates have a [[mirror]] behind them as in a [[CD Player]], the same effect occurs.

#### ... [[resolution]]
- We write down that the resolution is contingent on the minimum observable wavelength difference $\Delta \lambda$ $$R={\lambda \over \Delta \lambda}$$
- To find an expression based on the slit density, claim that they are [[distinction, and indistinguishability|distinguishable]] when one peak coincides with the next.
- So $\phi=2\pi m$, then the next occurs at $\phi=2\pi m + 2\pi/N$ where $N$ is the number of slits. 
- The phase difference is then $\phi = (2\pi d\sin\theta)/\lambda$ so, $$d\phi = {2\pi d\cos d\theta \over \lambda}$$
- Taking $d\phi = 2\pi/N$, $$d\cos\theta \ d\theta = {\lambda / N}$$
- so to produce this much separation, $$R={\lambda \over d\lambda}=Nm=N{d\sin\theta \over \lambda}$$
