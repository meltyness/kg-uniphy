When an [[electronic configuration, and ionization]] process that produces [[emission spectra, absorption spectra and diffraction grating, spectroscopy|emission spectra]] is exposed to a [[magnetic field]], there is a splitting of the field lines. 

Forms a [[measurement device]] for [[degenerate quantum states]].

#### [[phenomenology]]
- There is an observed effect of an [[externality|external]] [[magnetic field]] onto the [[magnetic quantum number]] resulting in changes to the [[emission spectra, absorption spectra and diffraction grating, spectroscopy|emission spectra]].
- For a [[magnetic dipole]] with a [[magnetic moment]] with $$\vec{\mu}=I\vec{A}$$
- In a [[magnetic field]], $\vec{B}$ it experiences [[torque]] $$\vec{\tau} = \vec{\mu}\cdot\vec{B}$$
- Using the [[Bohr magneton]], $$\mu_B = {e\hbar \over 2m}\approx5.788\times10^{-5} \text { eV/T}$$
- However from [[hydrogen#... an analysis of the atom using the Schrödinger equation , and quantum mechanics]] for $n=1$ in the ground state $m_l=0$. 
- Then the change in potential $\Delta E$ with $m_l$ is like $$U=-\mu_zB = m_l{e\hbar \over 2m}B$$
- This leads to the presence of [[quantum selection rules]] where $(m_l = 2 \rightarrow m_l=1)^✔$, $(m_l=1 \rightarrow m_l=-1)^❌$
- This is called [[hyperfine structure]]
