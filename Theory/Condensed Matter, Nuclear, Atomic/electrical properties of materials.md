#C17-1 

A [[temperature]]-dependent [[material]] [[physical quantities]]. A [[semiconductors]] has this property.

#### ... [[current-voltage relationship]]
A more general property of material behavior

#### ... [[electrical conductivity, and resistivity]], [[Ohm's law]]
Where [[electrons]], and other [[elementary entities]]move freely.

#### ... [[dielectric, and dielectric strength]]
Regarding non-conducting materials,
- [[material phase change]] in a system modeled as a [[ideal capacitor]] may occur with very large [[voltage, or electric potential]], and result in a non-conducting material becoming conducting, typically modeled as [[capacitive breakdown]].
