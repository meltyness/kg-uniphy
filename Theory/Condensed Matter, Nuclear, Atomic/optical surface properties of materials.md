#C33-2 
A rough [[kind of material]] is likely to produce [[diffuse reflection]], for a [[material smooth surface]] we [[describe outcomes|observe]] for the following properties:

#### ... [[specular reflection]]
 a smooth [[electrical conductivity, and resistivity|conductor]] is predisposed to produce [[specular reflection]]. Additionally [[law of total internal reflection]] can cause specular reflection in certain circumstances.

#### ... [[birefringence]]
This produces [[polarization of optical rays]]

#### ... [[polarizing filters]]
These are also of interest in [[engineering of materials]].

#### ... [[beam splitter]]
Via the [[engineering of materials]] and [[deposition and epitaxy]] a controlled amount of an [[optical ray]] can be permitted through, or via [[law of dielectric reflection, and phase shifting]].

#### ... [[thin film]] [[interference of light waves]]
As observed macroscopically in bubble [[cavitation]], [[semiconductors]], [[emission spectra, absorption spectra and diffraction grating, spectroscopy]]

#Caution people get these two things wrong, often.
#### ... [[optical junction refractive dispersion]]
Another descriptor is the [[optical junction refractive dispersion]], which for **most** materials, descreases the [[index of refraction]] for longer wavelengths.

#### ... [[Rayleigh scattering]]
We may also need to consider [[Rayleigh scattering]] in some cases, as at certain scales this effect takes hold producing considerable effects in terms of changes to the [[electromagnetic spectrum, frequency of light]] and [[electromagnetic wave polarization]].
