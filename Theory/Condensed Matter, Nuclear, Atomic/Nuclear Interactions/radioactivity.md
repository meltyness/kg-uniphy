#C43-4

Following from [[law of alpha particle decay]], [[law of beta particle decay and capture]], [[law of gamma decay]], as well as the [[Segr√® chart]] structure documenting stability and [[nuclear lifetime]] given the [[atomic speciation, nuclides, isotope]], natural isotopes tend to undergo decay with [[task|processes]] documented here.

##### ... radioactive decay rate, and decay constant
Noting that this is an inherently [[how much on average|statistical process]] where we can only describe [[differential equations]] $${dN(t)\over dt}=\lambda N(t)$$
then $$N(t)=N_0e^{-\lambda t}$$
where $\lambda$ is the decay constant that varies by nuclide.

The half-life, $T_{1/2}$ is then given by $$\frac{1}{2}=N_0e^{-T_{1/2}\lambda} \implies T_{1/2}={\ln 2 \over \lambda}$$
and we also define [[nuclear lifetime]], $$T_\text{mean}={1 \over \lambda}={T_{1/2} \over \ln 2}$$
The total activity is measured using the [[curie]], $$1 \text{ Ci} = 3.70\times10^{10} \text{ Bq} = 3.70\times10^{10} \text{ decays/s}$$
