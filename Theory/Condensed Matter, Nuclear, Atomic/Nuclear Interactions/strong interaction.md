#C43-2

One of the [[fundamental forces]] that creates the [[self-energy]] and [[nuclear binding]] in the [[nucleus]] of all [[atom]].

#### ... [[Yukawa potential]]
Predicts the [[potential energy]] of the strong interaction.

#### ... [[semi-empirical nuclear model]]

#### ... [[nuclear shell model]]
By [[analogy]] to the [[central-field approximation]], compute the [[self-energy]] for [[incident]] [[nucleons]] in terms of the average [[potential energy]], accounting for the [[repulsion]] due to [[electrical potential energy]].

[[nuclear magic numbers]] occur in certain [[atomic speciation, nuclides, isotope]] presumably due to the observed even-favoredness noted below.

##### [[phenomenology]]
- A short range force between [[neutrons]] and [[protons]], which acts equally between them
- The [[self-energy]] per [[neutrons]] and [[protons]] is nearly a constant.
- Nearest-neighbor interactions are important, but even at the range of the nucleus, constituent nuclide interactions may be disregarded, and effect called [[nuclear force saturation]].
- The force favors binding [[nuclear magic numbers]]
	- pairs of [[protons]] with opposite [[nuclear spin quantum number]]
	- quads of [[protons]]-[[neutrons]] pairs with mutually opposite [[nuclear spin quantum number]]
	- hence the [[alpha particles]] large [[nuclear lifetime]]
	- this is similar to the [[hypotheses]] production of [[Cooper pairs]] in a [[superconductor]]
- The subject of [[high-energy mechanics]]
	- [[law of conditional strangeness conservation]]
	- [[law of lepton number conservation]]
	- [[law of baryon number conservation]]
	- [[law of conditional isospin conservation]]
	- [[law of conditional parity conservation]]
