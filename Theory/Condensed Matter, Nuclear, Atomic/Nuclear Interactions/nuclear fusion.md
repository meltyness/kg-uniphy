A kind of [[nuclear reactions]] where [[nucleons]] [[intramolecular motion|approach]] until their surfaces are in contact, undergo [[subatomic particle collisions]] at $r \approx 1.2\times 10^{-15} \text{ m}$. Two [[nucleus]] approach until their surfaces are in contact, $r \approx 3.5\times 10^{-15} \text{ m}$.

Generally, $$\text{input nuclides} \rightarrow \text{output nuclides} + \text{radiation, balancing binding energy}$$


#### [[phenomenology]]
- A kind of [[nuclear transmutation]] that for low [[atomic number]] [[atomic speciation, nuclides, isotope|nuclides]] results in an [[exoergic nuclear reaction]] [[nuclear reactions|reaction]], due to the change in [[nuclear binding]], the [[proton-proton chain]] occurs in [[stars]] $${}_1^1\text{H}+{}_1^1\text{H} \rightarrow {}_1^2\text{H} + \beta^+ + \nu_e$$$${}_1^2\text{H}+{}_1^1\text{H} \rightarrow {}_2^3\text{He} + \gamma$$$${}_2^3\text{He}+{}_2^3\text{He} \rightarrow {}_2^4\text{He} + {}_1^1\text{H}+{}_1^1\text{H}$$
- The goal of achieving these sort of reactions for the purpose of [[electrical energy storage, generation, and transmission]] is the subject of [[cold fusion]]
