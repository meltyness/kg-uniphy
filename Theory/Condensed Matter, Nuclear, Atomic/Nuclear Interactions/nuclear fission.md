#C23-E 

When a [[nucleus]] is [[bisected]], the [[self-energy]] contained undergoes [[energy transformation and heat flow]].

This effect is used in [[energy storage and transmission]], as well as [[Atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]].

A kind of [[nuclear reactions]]

#### [[phenomenology]]
- Under #20thCentury  [[experiment or measurement|investigation of]] [[neutron absorption]] in [[uranium]], it was realized that the [[nucleus]] had undergone [[nuclear decay]] into two other large nuclei, called [[fission fragments]], and [[representation]] in [[Segr√® chart]].
- There are two types [[spontaneous fission]], and [[induced fission]]
- [[fission fragments]] always have too many [[neutrons]] to be stable
- The [[semi-empirical nuclear model]] assists in understanding this, especially understanding the presence of [[nuclear excited states]], [[quantum tunneling]] may also play a role.
- This also results in a [[cascade]] of such events, where a nearby fission increases likelihood of further fission throughout the [[material system]].
- The cascade can be put under control with a [[moderator material]], and [[gaseous diffusion processing of uranium]] is used to provide [[human control]] to $\approx 3\%$ ${}^{235}\text{U}$ to produce [[nuclear reactor]]
