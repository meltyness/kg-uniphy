In the #20thCentury modeling specifically [[hydrogen]], [[Niehls Bohr]] observed that the [[emission spectra, absorption spectra and diffraction grating, spectroscopy]] suggested [[quantum]] effects between permissible [[electrical potential energy]] for the [[electrons]] as they orbited the [[nucleus]].

Treats the structure as an [[analogy]] to [[Kepler's laws]].

In the Bohr model the [[electrons]] orbit the [[nucleus]]

##### ... and [[emission spectra, absorption spectra and diffraction grating, spectroscopy|emission spectra]]
When an atom moves from one energy level to another,  $$hf={hc \over \lambda} = E_i-E_f$$
##### ... and [[hydrogen]] 
(similar in form to [[the lensmaker's equation]]) we have the [[Balmer series]] of spectral lines for hydrogen, $${1 \over \lambda} = R\bigg({1 \over 2^2} - {1 \over n^2}\bigg) \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (n=3, 4, 5,\dots)$$
Where $R$ is the [[Rydberg constant]], $R=1.097\times10^7 \text{ m}^{-1}$.

This also gives the [[electronic configuration, and ionization]] [[energy]] and can be solved like  $$E_n=-{hcR \over n^2} \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (n=1,2, \dots)$$

#### ... and [[quantum mechanics]]
Due to the observed thresholding of [[photon]] [[emission]] [[energy]], [[Niehls Bohr]] determined that the [[atomic angular momentum is quantized]]. 

- [[formula]] [[derivation]] is like
- Write down observed [[angular momentum]] relationship, $$L=mv_nr_n=n{h \over 2\pi}
$$
- From [[Coulomb's law]], [[Newton's second law of motion]],  $${1 \over 4\pi\epsilon_0}{e^2 \over r_n^2}={mv_n^2 \over r_n}$$
- And then we can solve,$$r_n=\epsilon_0{n^2h^2 \over \pi me^2}\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ v_n={1 \over \epsilon_0}{e^2 \over 2nh}$$
- and further by computing the [[total mechanical energy]], $K$ from [[kinetic energy]] and $U$ from the [[electrical potential energy]] and comparing to the expression for hydrogen from the Balmer series, above (i.e., still [[empirical laws]]) $$R={me^4 \over 8\epsilon_0^2h^3c}$$
