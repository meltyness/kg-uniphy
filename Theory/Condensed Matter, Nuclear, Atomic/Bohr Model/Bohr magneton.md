A [[magnetic interaction|magnetic]] [[elementary entities|entity]].

All familar [[atom]], contain [[electrons]] forming [[electrical current]] in a [[solenoid, and current loops|current loop]] as an [[Bohr model of the atom|orbital]] which produce a [[magnetic field]]. Often there is no net field, but when exposed to an external field develops a form of [[magnetic order]] and the [[material system]] becomes [[magnetization density|magnetized]].

Taking the [[Bohr model of the atom]], the [[electrons]] in a circular orbit around the [[nucleus]] in a [[electrical current]] [[solenoid, and current loops|loop]]. Following from [[motion of charges in a magnetic field#subatomic particle in a steady magnetic field|cyclotron frequency]], $$T={2\pi r \over v}$$
and finding the equivalent current $$I={e \over T}= {ev \over 2\pi r}$$
	Then the [[magnetic moment]], $\mu = IA$ becomes, and because [[atomic angular momentum is quantized]], rewriting direct in terms of the [[angular momentum]] $L=mvr$ $$\mu = {evr \over 2}={e \over 2m}L$$
In addition the direction of $\vec{L}$ is uncertain and therefore of $\vec{\mu}$ as well. 
	
In discussing $\mu, L$ ahead read as "[[quantum superposition|maximum component in a given direction]]." So with the quantized version of $L$, $L=h/2\pi$ 
$$\mu = {e \over 2m}\bigg({h \over 2\pi}\bigg)={eh \over 2\pi m}$$
this [[physical quantities]] is called the [[Bohr magneton]], $\mu_B$ with $$\mu_B = 9.274\times 10^{-24} \text{ A m}^2 = 9.274\times 10^{-24} \text{ J/T}$$
And this moment is distinct from [[particle spin quantum number]].
