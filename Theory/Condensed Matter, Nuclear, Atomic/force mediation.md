#C44-1 

Following from [[Heisenberg uncertainty principle]], $$\Delta E \Delta t \ge \hbar$$
we can [[employ deductive reasoning]] to conclude that it is allowable to describe [[fundamental forces]] in terms of [[subatomic particle]] with a limited [[subatomic particle lifetime]], before undergoing [[subatomic particle decay]].

Such a [[subatomic particle]] is called a [[virtual subatomic particle]]

|[[fundamental forces]]|relative strength|range| mediating particle | lifetime| (mass, charge, spin)|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|[[strong interaction]]|1|$\approx 1 \text{ fm}$ (short)|[[gluon]]|$5.0\times10^{-24} \text{ s}$|(0,0,1) |
|[[electromagnetic interaction]]|$1/137$|$1/r^2$ (long)|[[photon]]||(0,0,1)|
|[[weak interaction]]|$10^{-9}$|$\approx 0.001 \text{ fm}$ (short)|[[W-Z bosons]]||(80.4/91.2 $\text{ GeV/c}^2$,$\pm e \text{ or } 0$, 1) |
|[[gravitational interaction]]|$10^{-38}$|$1/r^2$ (long)|[[graviton]]||(0,0,2)|

We can compute the relative strength using $k_e, G$ as the [[coupling constant]], for example $${1 \over 4\pi\epsilon_0}{e^2 \over \hbar c} = {1 \over 137.0}$$
