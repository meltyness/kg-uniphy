#C38-9 
 QED enables the [[synthesis]] of [[photon]] descriptions of phenomena and [[electromagnetic waves and light]] descriptions of phenomena.

It does so with the following suppositions:
- To explain by [[analogy]] similar to the quantization of the [[electron energy level]] in an [[atom]] 
	- The [[electric field]] and [[magnetic field]] takes on specific well-defined [[states]] according to [[collections]] of [[photon]] with individual [[quantum]]
		- [[energy]]
		- [[momentum]]
		- [[electromagnetic wave polarization]]
