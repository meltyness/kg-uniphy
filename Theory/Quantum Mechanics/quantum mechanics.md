While [[relativity]] describes phenomena involving very large [[momentum]], smaller [[momentum]] phenomena such as the [[atom]], [[nucleus]] begin to exhibit behavior as a [[wave]], such as the relationship between the [[photon]] and [[electromagnetic waves and light]]. Via [[complementarity principle]] we accept two descriptions, and quantum mechanics provides [[synthesis]] between them through the [[Schrödinger equation]].

#### ... the [[de Broglie wavelength]]
The [[wavelength]] of a [[subatomic particle]] is [[derivation|derived]] from its [[momentum]] the following to give [[formula]],
- A [[subatomic particle]] with [[rest mass]], $m_0$ (recall we may need to account for [[Einstein's special theory of relativity|relativistic mass]])$$\lambda = {h \over p} = {h \over mv}$$
- Which would also imply that $E=hf$, as with the [[photon]], typically on order [[electron volt]].

#### ... the [[Heisenberg uncertainty principle]]
This is a key tool in [[quantum kinematics]], since there is a sort of [[speed limit]] on [[precision, accuracy, uncertainty, and significant figures]].

#### ... the [[Schrödinger equation]]
A [[differential equation, or principle]] relating [[wavefunction]] used to satisfy the [[complementarity principle]], which provides a pathway to a [[quantum kinematics]].

##### ... using the [[Schrödinger equation]] to predict $\psi$
- By describing a particle in terms of its environment:
	- $U(x)$
- Its [[kinetic energy]], and [[rest mass]] ( #Waitwhat do other [[mass]] representations matter?)
	- $E,m$
- We can write a [[partial differential equations]] relating $\psi$ to those quantities

##### ... [[quantum tunneling]]
- For a finite [[potential well]], $U(x)$ then quantum tunneling may be observed with a [[probability]] of observing the [[wavefunction]] on the other side.

#### ... [[electronic configuration, and ionization]] of [[hydrogen]]
See the article on [[hydrogen]] for more details, and a brief overview of [[quantum states]].

#### ... [[the Zeeman effect]]
This describes the effect of [[emission spectra, absorption spectra and diffraction grating, spectroscopy|splitting of spectral lines]] in a [[magnetic field]]. 

##### ... the [[Stern-Gerlach experiment]] and [[particle spin quantum number]]
Similar to [[the Zeeman effect]], patterns in the [[emission spectra, absorption spectra and diffraction grating, spectroscopy|emission spectra]] are explained by quantum mechanics. These effects imply every atom is a [[magnetic dipole]] with [[magnetic moment]], $$\vec{J}=\vec{L} + \vec{S}$$
#### ... the [[Pauli exclusion principle]] and [[central-field approximation]]
No two [[subatomic particle]] can occupy the same [[quantum states]].

#### ... [[Moseley's law]]
In [[x-ray crystallography]], and [[x-ray machines, and production]], and an [[analogy]] to the [[Balmer series]] we fire an x-ray [[photon]] at a [[specimen]], and observe the emitted $f$, which provides a method of finding $Z$ predicted [[atomic number]] of the specimen. $$f=(2.48\times10^{15} \text { Hz})(Z-1)^2$$
additionally, [[emission spectra, absorption spectra and diffraction grating, spectroscopy|absorption spectra]] can be observed for $Z\ge 10$.

#### ... [[natural light, and continuous spectra]]
Quantum mechanics forms an explanation of this phenomena as well.

#### [[phenomenology]]
- [[photon#diffraction of light waves and elementary particle duality|Individual photons exhibit diffraction, even though they are observed to arrive independently]]
- The [[photoelectric effect]] demonstrates that it is the [[energy]] of individual photons that scatters electrons, not the [[wave intensity]].
- Any [[atom]] or [[molecule]] exhibits
	- [[electronic configuration, and ionization]]
	- [[electron energy level]], [[electron shell level, or orbit]]
	- [[emission spectra, absorption spectra and diffraction grating, spectroscopy|emission spectra]]
	- [[chemical and molecular bonding]]
	- #WaitWhat 
		- what about [[atom excitation lifetime]]?
		- what about [[metastable state]]?
		- what about permissible [[state change]] of the [[electrons]]?
- [[extending an apparent duality]] [[material]] [[subatomic particle]] also exhibit [[wave]] behavior

##### ... in an [[atom]] [[electron shell level, or orbit]]
- In [[electronic configuration, and ionization]] of an [[atom]], and to contrast with the [[Bohr model of the atom]]
	- It is still the case that [[atomic angular momentum is quantized]]
	- The [[quantum kinematics]] is different, however.
	- Starting with $L=mvr \propto h$ as a kind of [[wave medium boundary]] and [[analogy]] to [[standing mechanical waves]].
	- So the [[electrons]] motion is a standing wave in an [[closed orbits]] radius $r$, so we establish $2\pi r=n\lambda$ for the electron to actually be a standing wave.
	- Combining this with the [[de Broglie wavelength]] implies a [[boundary condition]] $$mvr=n{h\over2\pi}$$
	- This behavior was confirmed with a [[Davisson-Germer apparatus]]
