#C33-5 

A [[electromagnetic waves and light]] or [[optical ray]] where all possible [[angle]] are in equal [[superposition of fields|superposition]], arises from [[random motion]], such as in [[incandescent light bulbs]] or [[stars]].

[[random direction changes]] lead to an equal [[concentration]] in the [[optical ray]] of every [[angle]].

For a given [[light intensity]], this can be [[formula|written]] $${I_0 \over 2\pi}$$
#### [[phenomenology]]
- As opposed to [[emission spectra, absorption spectra and diffraction grating, spectroscopy|line spectra]] and those sharp lines emitted by [[gas]], many materials such as [[combustion]], [[stars]], [[heating coil]] produce continuous spectra.
	- [[ideal blackbody]], [[emissivity]] are related concepts.

#### [[formula]] [[derivation]]
We previously described the [[Stefan-Boltzmann law]], for a given [[temperature]], and where $\sigma$ is the [[Stefan-Boltzmann constant]] $$I=\sigma T^4$$
- This can also be written as an [[integral]] across the [[resonance]] [[density]] $$I=\int_0^\infty I(\lambda)d\lambda$$
- An [[empirical laws]] characterizing such curves $I(\lambda)$ follow [[Wien displacement law]], producing a maxima at $\lambda_m$ where $$\lambda_mT=2.90\times10^{-3}\text{ m K}$$
- Following from arguments regarding [[standing electromagnetic waves]] and the [[normal modes of a mechanical wave|normal modes possible]] in a [[space]] and using the [[principle of equipartition of energy]] to claim that all possible modes would be endowed uniformly with $I(\lambda)$ one can derive [[archaic]] $${dR \over d\lambda}=I(\lambda)={2\pi ckT \over \lambda^4}$$

- There was a disagreement between this and [[experiment or measurement]] called the [[Blackbody Radiation Disaster]] until [[Max Karl Ernst Ludwig Planck]] [[derivation|derived]] [[Planck radiation law]] #ProofDeferred 
- Planck [[constantly make an educated guess about the sign or direction|assumed]] that [[electromagnetic spectrum, frequency of light]] was [[quantum]] in nature and therefore each mode had energy$$E=nhf$$
- and then it followed that $$I(\lambda) = {2\pi hc^2 \over \lambda^5(e^{hc/\lambda kT}-1)}$$
- And from this you can also compute [[Wien displacement law]], [[Stefan-Boltzmann law]].
- [[models are sometimes derived before they are clearly understood]] [[rough timeline of quantum mechanics]]
- [[hypotheses]], #WaitWhat I presume [[Pauli exclusion principle]] probably provides the [[explanation]] for why there are so much fewer modes for short-wavelength states.
