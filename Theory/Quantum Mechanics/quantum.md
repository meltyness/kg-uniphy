#C17-3 

The effects of [[material]] at very low [[mass density]], [[temperature]], and [[total mechanical energy]].

#### Quantization
A [[physical quantities]] that only varies with discrete changes, for example in an [[atom]] the [[angular momentum]] of the [[electrons]] in its [[electronic configuration, and ionization]] is quantized. That is, [[atomic angular momentum is quantized]] as in the discussion of the [[Bohr magneton]].
