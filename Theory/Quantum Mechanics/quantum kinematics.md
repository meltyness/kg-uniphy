Using the [[wavefunction]] and [[Schr√∂dinger equation]],

Following from the description of [[mechanical waves]], [[sound waves]], [[electromagnetic waves and light]] $$y(x,t)=A\cos(kx-\omega t)$$
Such that each [[point object]] undergoes [[simple harmonic motion]], 

#### ... [[formula]] 
#ProofDeferred #OutOfScope 
A [[wavefunction]], $$\Psi(x,y,z,t)$$
is sufficient to determine [[how much on average]] regarding [[information measure paradox]]
- [[position]]
- [[velocity]]
- [[momentum]]
- [[energy]]

That is, [[the wavefunction forms a complete dualistic description of the motion state of a subatomic particle]].

##### ... the [[wavefunction]] as a [[probability density]]
- The wavefunction is a complete description of the [[quantum]] [[motion]]
	- Consider an [[analogy]] that $$\text{wavefunction : quantum :: field wave equation : electromagnetic wave}$$
- The wavefunction identifies the [[probability density]] of an [[event]]
	- And that in finding the [[light intensity]] in the [[double-slit experiment]] we used $I\propto E^2$
- The [[probability]] of finding the [[quantum]] [[material]] in an [[event]] in [[space]] is then given (and that $\Psi$ must be [[Normal distribution|normalized]]) $$p=|\Psi(x,y,z,t)|^2\ dV \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \int_S|\Psi|^2dV=1.0$$
##### ... the [[wavefunction]] of a [[stationary state]]/[[standing wave particle, bound state, stationary state]]
- In the [[electronic configuration, and ionization]] of an [[atom]], where an [[electrons|electron]] has a [[definite]] [[electron energy level]], which doesn't vary with time it is called a [[stationary state]].
	- #Caution this isn't necessarily the natural state of things.
- For an [[electrons]] with $E$ in an [[atom]], $$\Psi(x,y,z,t)=\psi(x,y,z)e^{-iEt/\hbar} \implies|\Psi|^2=|\psi(x,y,z)|^2$$

##### ... [[equiprobable surfaces]]
- A kind of [[representation]] of the wavefunction of a [[particle]] or [[elementary entities]] where the probability is equally likely.
