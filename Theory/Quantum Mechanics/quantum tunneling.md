#C40-3

A statement regarding whether or not a [[potential well]] can [[occlude or filter]] a [[subatomic particle]].

This can be observed in [[nucleus]] tunneling through their [[electronic configuration, and ionization|electron configuration]], and result in [[nuclear fusion]], as well as [[radioactivity]] for the [[emission]] of [[alpha particles]].

#### ... square tunneling [[how much on average|probability]]
This is given #ProofDeferred by the [[formula]], $$p(T)=Ge^{-2\kappa L}$$
$$G=16{E \over U_0}(1-{E\over U_0})$$
$$\kappa = \sqrt{2m(U_0-E) \over \hbar}$$

#### ... [[penetration distance|Penetration distance]]
#C40-E
The [[displacement]], $\eta$ where, $$\psi(x=L+\eta)={1 \over e}\psi(x=L)$$
which for a finite square [[potential well]] is, $$\eta = {\hbar \over \sqrt{2m(U_0-E)}}$$
#### Applications
- [[scanning tunneling microscope]]
- In a close pair of  [[electrical wire, or terminal]], even with a [[dielectric, and dielectric strength|dielectric]] [[electrical conductivity, and resistivity|jacket]], there is still a [[probability]] of [[elementary entities]] appearing on the other side.
- In implementing a kind of [[diode]] called the tunnel diode.
- As a form of [[transmission]].
