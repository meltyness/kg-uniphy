#C14-1

[[fluid|Fluid]] mechanics are important, and have already been encountered in the context of [[motion#flow slosh|flow, and slosh mentioned briefly as forms of motion]] as well as [[aerodynamics]], [[fluid resistance]], and as a cause of [[bulk stress]].

#### ...[[pressure]] of fluids
#C14-2 
Pressure is a [[scalar quantity]] related to a [[force]] [[externality|exerted]] by a fluid as a [[bulk stress]] on any object in [[contact force|contact]] with it. For a small part of such a [[surface area|surface]], [[formula|we have]] $$p = {dF_\perp \over dA}$$
Taking this a more general sense we arrive at [[Pascal's law]]

#### ...[[buoyancy]] of fluids
Buoyancy is the [[externality|external]] [[force]] that a [[volume|displaced]] fluid applies to an [[rigid body|object]], and is governed by [[Archimedes' principle]]. 

A related force is [[surface tension]], through which such a force may be transmitted.

#### ...[[fluid flow]] of fluids
Flow of fluids is goverened by the [[fluid flow|continuity equation]].

#### ...[[energy of fluids]]
[[Bernoulli's equation]] governs the energy of fluids.
