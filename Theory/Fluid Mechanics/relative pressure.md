#C14-2 

Typically pressure is measured relative to the atmosphere. Clarifying terms: [[absolute pressure]] and [[gauge pressure]] are intended to clarify this.

Excess pressure, above [[atmosphere|atmospheric]] is called "gauge pressure."

#C14-2 

When [[experiment or measurement|measuring]] [[pressure]] a certain type of [[measurement device]] may only measure the [[differential equation, or principle|difference]] between the [[pressure]] and the [[atmosphere]], for example a [[barometer]] would operate like this due to the form of [[Pascal's law]].
