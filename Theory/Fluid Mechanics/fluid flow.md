#C14-4

Flow is a [[motion]] of [[fluid]].

An [[ideal fluid]] has the following properties:
- [[tensile-compressive stress|incompressible]]
- [[viscosity]]

Individual particles move along [[flow lines]]. If the pattern is constant with time it is called [[steady flow]]. A [[streamline]] is a curve whose tangent at any point is in the direction of [[fluid velocity]] at that point. The [[fluid velocity]] past a certain point is also called the [[flux]], and in the case of leaving a container the [[efflux]].

If the flow is not steady (time-varying), then the flow-lines won't necessarily match the streamlines.

A common way to visualize the difference is [[laminar flow]] vs [[turbulent flow]].

#### Continuity equation
Following from the incompressibility and, mass conservation we have $$A_1v_1 = A_2v_2 \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \text{(continuity equation, incompressible fluid)}$$
and $${dV \over dt} = Av$$
as the volume as a function of time. and it follows that $${dm\over dt} = \rho{dV \over dt}$$
