[[ripples]], [[sound]], [[ultrasound]], and [[earth, atmosphere, water, and wildlife|earthquakes]] are all examples of a [[wave]].

This type of [[motion]] is carried in [[material]] [[wave medium]].

#### Types
A [[transverse wave]] [[displacement|displaces]] the [[medium]] in a direction different to the [[velocity|direction of travel]], as with an applied [[tension force]] [[impulse]].

A [[longitudinal wave]] displaces the medium [[in parallel]] to the direction of travel, as with [[pressure]], which produces [[tensile-compressive stress|compression and rarefaction]]

A [[surface wave]] is a combination of the two that produces [[kinematics of circular motion|circular motion]] via [[surface tension]] of the upper [[molecule|molecular surface of water]] -- composed of both [[transverse wave]] and [[longitudinal wave]] components.

A [[wave pulse]] is just a single, as opposed to a [[periodic wave]].

If we produce a [[simple harmonic motion]] and attach it to a medium, such as a [[rope]],
those facets carry through, with [[crests]] and [[troughs]], separated along a length $\lambda$ called the [[wavelength]]. [[when a sinusoidal wave passes through a medium, every particle in the medium undergoes simple harmonic motion with the same frequency]]
