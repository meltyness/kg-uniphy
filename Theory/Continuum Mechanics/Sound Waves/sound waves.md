#C15-4 
They travel at the [[speed of sound]], depending on the [[wave medium]].

They have a [[frequency|pitch]], and a [[fundamental frequency]], and typically also exhibit [[timbre]].

in some sense, like an [[eulerian acceleration]] because of the definition of a longitudinal wave. They come from a [[source of sound]].

#WaitWhat 
>When a listener compares two sinusoidal sound waves with the same frequency, but different pressure amplitudese the one with the greater pressure amplitude is usually perceived as [...] slightly lower in pitch

#### ...[[dynamics of a sound wave]]
Sound waves come from [[pressure]].

#### ...[[kinematics of sound waves]]
Generally speaking, these are [[pressure]] [[ripples]].

#### ...[[sound waves and work, power, energy]]
 modeled with [[wave intensity]].

#### ... [[standing sound waves]]
Just like [[standing mechanical waves]]

#### ... [[interference of mechanical waves]]
Sound waves experience this too.

#### ... [[beats]]
Sound waves with different [[frequency]] do this.

#### ...[[Doppler effect]]
A source of sound can be moving

#### ...[[supersonic flight]]
faster than the [[speed of sound]]
