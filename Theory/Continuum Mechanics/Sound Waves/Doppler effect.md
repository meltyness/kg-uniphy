#C16-8

When a [[source of sound]] or a [[microphone]] is [[kinematics in space|in motion]], the [[wavelength]] produced or observed varies.

There is also a [[Doppler effect for electromagnetic waves]]

- the [[relative velocity]] between the [[wavefront]] traveling at the [[speed of sound]], and the source
- the [[relative velocity]] betwen the [[wavefront]] traveling at the [[speed of sound]], and the listener, or microphones

#### [[formula]]
With the relationship $v=\lambda f$ we and a listener traveling with $v_L$ we can write $v+v_L=\lambda f_L$ $$f_L = {v+v_L \over \lambda}$$ and taking into consideration the $f$ observed, $v+v_S=\lambda f_S$ $$f_L={v+v_L \over v+v_S}f_S$$
Really this is a simplified model, to model this in full need to consider the superposition of all disturbances in space as they would be observed by the listener, in addition to modelling how they would be emplaced.
