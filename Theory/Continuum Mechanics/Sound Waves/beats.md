#C16-7

Two [[tuning fork]] with different [[frequency]] exhibit this, and [[oscillatory kinematics|oscillate]] between being nearly [[phase|in-phase]], and nearly [[phase|out-of-phase]] which results in a variable [[sound intensity level]] and [[interference of mechanical waves|destructive interference]]. It is used to implement [[human control]] of [[frequency]] for [[musical instrument]] or [[planes and flight]] by [[fan|propellor]].

#### [[formula]]
Following from [[interference of mechanical waves]], the combination of a wave with different frequencies results in a "beat" with $f_a > f_b$ we have
$$f_\text{beat}=f_a-f_b$$
