#C15-8

Invented by [[Joseph Fourier]], provides a tool for [[harmonic analysis]].

Converts the [[kinematics of sound waves]] [[time]]-domain description into a [[frequency]] [[amplitude]] description of the [[timbre]] [[fingerprint]] and [[harmonic series]].

Notice too that the [[Fourier transform]] takes on the same form as a weighted-sum, like those encountered in dealing with [[probability density]].
