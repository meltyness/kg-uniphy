Through a [[test volume]] we can determine the [[mechanical waves and work, power, energy|wave energy]] [[differential equation, or principle|difference]] between two [[displacement]] from the [[simple harmonic motion|source]].

#### Discussion of [[physical quantities|units]]
The units of measure are $$1 \ \ \text{W / m}^2$$ and in the case of [[sound waves]], the [[decibel]] is commonly used
