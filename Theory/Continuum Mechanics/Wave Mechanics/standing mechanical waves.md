Standing [[sinusoidal waves]] result in [[dynamic equilibrium]] [[simple harmonic motion]] of each particle.

- [[mechanical wave node]] is where the wave exhibits no [[transverse wave|transverse]] amplitude.
- [[mechanical wave antinode]] is where the wave exhibits maximal [[amplitude]].

This follows from [[principle of superposition of waves]], between the [[incident]] and [[reflection]]  and a simple application of trigonometric identities yields the following [[formula]], for [[reflection of mechanical waves#For a fixed wave medium boundary|fixed]] [[wave medium boundary]] where $A_\text{SW} = 2A$ ...
$$y(x,t)=(A_\text{SW}\sin{kx})\sin{\omega t}$$

And with a [[reflection of mechanical waves#For a free wave medium boundary|free]] one, we can describe similarly with $$y(x,t)=(A_\text{SW}\cos{kx})\sin{\omega t}$$
We also have that the [[mechanical wave node]] can be found at $kx \implies \cos{kx} = 0 \vee \sin{kx} = 0$

#WaitWhat What would a plucked [[musical instrument]] sound like, if [[build, or part|constructed]] with free, rather than fixed points of attachments -- maybe with a great deal of lubricant, centering axel... oooh, sounds like a project #NeatIdea 

#### ... in terms of [[normal modes of a mechanical wave|normal modes]]
#15-8
Now, for a string of arbitrary length, $L$, in the case of a fixed string, this constraint implies a node at both sides, $$L = n{\lambda \over 2} \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \text{(n=1,2,3...)}$$ Then the possible [[wavelength]] of the string are $$\lambda_n = {2L \over n}$$
and changing from [[wavelength]] to [[frequency]] with $v=\lambda f$ we get the [[harmonic series]] which describe the [[normal modes of a mechanical wave|normal modes]]$$f_n = n{v \over 2L}= nf_1$$
where $n=1$ corresponds to the [[fundamental frequency]] of the [[ideal string|string]].

And putting that all together with [[wave speed]], $v = \sqrt{F / \mu}$  $$f_n = {n\over 2L}\sqrt{F \over \mu}$$Complex systems typically have [[timbre|harmonic content]], like a [[fingerprint]] of their behavior described by [[harmonic analysis]] which can be performed with a [[Fourier series]].
