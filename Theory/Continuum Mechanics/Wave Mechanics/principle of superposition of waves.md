#C15-6 

When [[mechanical waves]], [[sound]], or [[electromagnetic waves and light]] overlap we have that the [[amplitude]] at any location [[formula|is given by ]]$$y(x,t)=y_1(x,t)+y_2(x,t)$$
This follows from the [[wave equation]] being linear, this is called the [[principle of linear superposition]]. 

#ConstructorTheory is it impossible to locate a *natural* medium that is non-linear. Is there some otherwise unifying distinction, at least?
