#C15-4 

In general, take $$v=\sqrt{\text{Restoring force towards} \over \text{Inertia resisting return to equilibrium}}$$
Notice #WaitWhat  that this implies there's a facet of the system [[clearly going off a cliff]] because of the ramping-type of oscillation this implies for [[standing mechanical waves]]. In the scope of [[sound waves]] this is called the [[speed of sound]]

Some examples of restoring forces are 
- [[spring force]]
- [[tension force]]
- [[bulk modulus]]
- [[Young's modulus]]

Some examples of *[[inertia]] resisting*
- $\mu$,... [[mass]] /[[length]]
- [[mass density]]
