Focusing on the case of [[sinusoidal waves]], a [[transverse wave]] has [[formula]] $$y=y(x,t)$$
#### ...for a specific [[particle]] 
with the equation, $y(x,t)=A\cos(kx - \omega t)$, we can [[differential equations|differentiate]] and find $$v_y=\omega A\sin(kx-\omega t)$$ and $$a_y = -\omega^2 A\cos(kx-\omega t)=-\omega^2y(x,t)$$
- #15-E, 15.55 An [[analogy]] and [[derivation]] trick can be used here to show that for a $\Delta x$ segment the equivalent $k$ experienced as from [[simple harmonic motion]] is $4\pi^2F \Delta x / \lambda^2$  associating back to the simpler case of [[spring force]]

we can also compute $${\partial^2 y \over \partial x^2}=-k^2A\cos(kx-\omega t) = -k^2y(x,t)$$
using [[phase speed]], below we can write $$ {\partial^2y/\partial t^2 \over \partial^2y / \partial x^2} = {\omega^2 \over k^2} = v^2$$
and then relating the two, we get the [[wave equation]], which has applications to [[electromagnetic spectrum, frequency of light]], [[electromagnetic interaction]] $${\partial y(x,t) \over \partial x^2} = {1 \over v^2}{\partial^2 y(x,t) \over \partial t^2}$$

#### With [[position]] and [[velocity]]
and for a specific case, which relates [[oscillatory period]], [[wavelength]], [[amplitude]] taking on the intuition that [[phase angle]] varies with [[displacement]]: $$y(x,t)=A\cos[\omega({x \over v} - t)] \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \text{(transverse wave in +x direction)}$$
Which raises closely related concept of [[wave number]], which simplifies our equation down to $$y(x,t)=A\cos(kx-\omega t)$$
#### Phase and phase-speed
$(kx\pm \omega t)$ is called a [[phase]] since it is a [[radian]] representing the [[states]] of a [[particle]] at a [[instant]] and [[displacement]].

And finally the [[phase speed]] is, $${dx \over dt} = {\omega \over k}$$
That is, assuming that you're "keeping up" with a specific [[troughs|trough]] on a [[wave pulse]], then, the phase is constant and it follows that the [[derivation]] is given:
$${d \over dt}[kx - \omega t = c] \implies k{dx \over dt}=\omega$$
