#C15-5
A [[mechanical waves]] carries with it, [[energy]], and can be considered as doing [[work]] on subsequent portions of the [[wave medium]]. Noting that mechanical waves travel in space leads to a concept of [[wave intensity]]

#### ...[[power]] of a [[mechanical waves|wave]]
Given our [[wave steady-state constraint]], where at a point $a$ in $x$ the force, $$F_y(x,t) = -F{\partial y(x,t) \over \partial x}$$
When $a$ moves in the $y$ direction, $F_y$ does work, from [[power#formula]] $\vec{P} = \vec{F} \cdot \vec{v}$, we can write $$P(x,t)=F_y(x,t)v_y(x,t)=-F{\partial y \over \partial x}{\partial y \over \partial t}$$
### ...for [[sinusoidal waves]] 
We can find $$P(x,t) = \sqrt{\mu T}{\omega^2 A^2\sin^2(kx-\omega t)}$$
$$P_\text{av} = \frac{1}{2}P_\text{max} = \frac{1}{2}\sqrt{\mu T}\omega^2A^2$$
#Caution this figure differs from that for [[electromagnetic waves and light]]

#### [[wave intensity]]
[[intensity is the power delivered by a wave, per unit area]]

Applying [[law of conservation of energy]], and considering the [[energy flux]] through a [[surface]] in [[space]] a [[displacement]] from the [[force]] or [[impulse]] producing it. The [[inverse square law]] for this point in the [[wavefront]] $$I = {P \over {4 \pi r^2}}$$and for t he same source, at two distances, $${I_1 \over I_2} = {r_2^2 \over r_1^2}$$
