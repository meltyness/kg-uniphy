#C15-6
The property of a [[wave medium]] that results in changing [[wave speed|wave velocity]] and possibly [[phase]], depending on whether the [[wave medium boundary]]

Wave reflection is dependent on the capability of [[mechanical waves]] to exhibit [[interference of mechanical waves]].

The [[thermodynamic state]] before reflection is called [[incident]], and after is called [[reflection]].

#ConstructorTheory all [[material]] is a [[wave medium boundary]] for [[electromagnetic waves and light]], or some other bizarre such cascading [[analogy]].

#### [[formula]]
##### For a fixed [[wave medium boundary]]
In this case, upon arrival at the [[wave medium boundary]], the medium exerts a [[transverse wave|transverse]] [[force]] onto the [[tension force|point of attachment]] opposing the [[incident]] motion. This force is met with an [[Newton's third law of motion|equal and opposite reaction]], so that the resulting [[wave pulse]] changes directions, and changes [[phase]].

##### For a free [[wave medium boundary]]
In this case, the only force experienced by the [[wave medium]] at the [[wave medium boundary]] is with the direction of [[tension force]], and so there is a change in direction but the wave does not change [[phase]].
