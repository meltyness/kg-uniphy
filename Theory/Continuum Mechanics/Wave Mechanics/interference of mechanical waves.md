#C15-6 

The [[thermodynamic state]] where a [[wave pulse]] overlaps a portion of a [[wave medium]].

Results in [[dissipative force]], lowering the [[amplitude]] in [[space]], [[air]], [[pressure]], [[height]].

[[wavefront]] arriving at a different [[time]] may result in [[loudness]] differences, where one could measure lower [[sound intensity level]] and [[sound waves and work, power, energy]].

This is used for some types of [[active noise cancellation]]

#### Destructive type
Occurs when the [[displacement]] plus the [[wavelength]] differ by a factor of $\lambda / 2$

#### Constructive type
Occurs when the [[displacement]] plus the [[wavelength]] differ by a factor of $\lambda$ for a constant tone.
