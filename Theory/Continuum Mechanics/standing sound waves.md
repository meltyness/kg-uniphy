#C16-4 

[[longitudinal wave|longitudinal]] [[sound waves]] in a [[fluid]] in a [[container]] undergo [[reflection of mechanical waves|reflection]], and are subject to [[principle of superposition of waves]] so that for a container of a certain [[length]], [[standing mechanical waves]] may occur.

This is the operating principle for [[wind instruments]], [[speak|speech]], and certain kinds of [[audible alarms]], as well as a [[Kundt's Tube]].

Recalling that [[pressure]] and [[displacement]] are $\text{90}^\circ$ apart in the [[dynamics of a sound wave]] we have the following principle:

[[A pressure node is always a displacement antinode, and a pressure antinode is always a displacement node]]

The relationships for [[fundamental frequency]] are still correct.

#### A look at the [[organ]]
Contains standing sound waves in [[resonance]].
