#C37-5 

A [[physical quantities]] and a [[vector quantity]] that is [[space]] and [[time]] serving as the defining facet of a [[coordinate system]] especially when subject to [[relativity]], and under consideration of [[simultaneity]] in two [[inertial frame of reference]] with a [[velocity]].

The need for this arises from the principle that [[space and time have become intertwined, we can no longer say that length and time have absolute meanings independent of the frame of reference]], following from the [[Lorentz transformation]].

#### ... the spacetime interval
For a given pair of [[event]] in one dimension, $$\Delta s = (c\Delta t)^2 - (\Delta x)^2$$
