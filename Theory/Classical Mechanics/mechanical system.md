#C7-1 
#KeyConcept 

As opposed to [[physical systems]] this is a [[abstract negligible facets|modelling abstraction]] for describing collections of [[abstract negligible facets|objects]] [[isolated system|in a vacuum]].

#### Special Concerns
- [[energy]] is a property of a system, not any one object, and it arises from
	- [[force]] extered between objects in the system are called [[internal forces]] as opposed to [[externality|external forces]].
- If there are no external forces the system is called "isolated."

- Some subtypes include
	- [[material system]] #WaitWhat how does this apply to the [[kinetic energy]] referenced in [[molecular motion]]?
	- [[isolated system]]
	- [[physical systems]]
	- [[wave medium]]
	- [[Holonomic systems]]
	- [[system]]
