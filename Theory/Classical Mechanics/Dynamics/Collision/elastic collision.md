#### Discussion
One way to model this is that the bodies involved are springs, which [[collision|quickly]] store the energy as [[elastic potential energy]], and expend it.

#### [[Models|Modeled]] in One Dimension [[formula]]
Applying [[law of conservation of energy]] and [[law of conservation of momentum]] for the [[state change]] of $A,B$ from [[states]] $1 \text{ to } 2$, where $v_{B1x} = 0$:
$$\frac{1}{2}m_Av_{A1x}^2+\frac{1}{2}m_Bv_{B1x}^2=\frac{1}{2}m_Av_{A2x}^2+\frac{1}{2}m_Bv_B2x^2$$
and $$m_Av_{A1x}+m_Bv_{B1x}=m_Av_{A2x}+m_Bv_{B2x}$$
can be solved down to $$v_{B2x}={2m_A \over {m_A+m_B}}v_{A1x}$$
In terms of [[relative velocity]], the sign of the relative velocities changes, but the magnitude stays the same.

#### Generalized
[[In an elastic collision, the relative velocity of the two bodies has the same magnitude before and after the collision]].
