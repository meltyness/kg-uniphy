#### Definition
It is a type of [[motion]] where [[rigid body|bodies]] [[interaction|interact]] for a short [[time]].

#### [[Representation]]
Collision is best described using the [[momentum]] and [[impulse]] [[dynamics]] constructs, [[law of conservation of momentum]], [[impulse-momentum theorem]].

In the absence of [[externality|external]] [[force]], [[law of conservation of momentum|momentum is conserved]].

#### Classes
Types of collisions can be classified by different properties.

Using the change in [[kinetic energy]] results in the following [[enumerate all apparently permissible configurations|classes]]:

##### [[elastic collision]]
The bodies bounce off of eachother, kinetic energy is conserved.

- Billiards balls
- [[particle]] physics

##### [[inelastic collision]]
The bodies merge together, and move as one with the same velocity, kinetic energy decreases.

- Gears coming into contact
- Asteroid [[planet]]
