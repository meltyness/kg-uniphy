#### Definition
For a [[rigid body]] [[composite system|composed]] of $i$ particles, we can consider their kinetic energy with respect to $m_i$ the mass of a [[particle]], and $r_i^2$ the square of the distance [[relative]] to a specific [[axis]]. Inertia in this sense is a [[scalar quantity]] with:
$$I=\sum_im_ir_i^2$$
#### ... for an arbitrary [[rigid body]] about an [[axis]]
For a small mass $dm$ a distance $r$ from a specific axis $X$,
$$I_X = \int r^2dm$$ Commonly we'll have [[mass density]] $\rho(r)$ so that $dm = \rho dV$.

#### ... with further generality
We can develop the [[inertial tensor]] which is a symmetric matrix, about a specific point of:
- [[product of inertia]] for [[principal axes|off-axis]] components
- the typical observed inertia listed above, for all three axes which is in common parlance as the "[[mass moment of inertia]]"
