#### Discussion, [[formula]]
For $i$ [[particle|particles]] with [[mass|masses]] $m_i$ each [[position|positioned]] at $\vec{r}_i$ the center of mass is:
$$\vec{r}_{cm} = {\sum_i{m_i\vec{r}_i} \over\sum_i m_i}$$
For homogenous materials with a geometric center, the center of mass corresponds. For [[axis symmetric]] objects, the center of mass is along the axis.

Related to [[center of gravity]]

We can relate the total [[momentum]] to the center's velocity, $$\vec{v}_{cm}={{m_1\vec{v}_{1}+m_2\vec{v}_{2}+\dots} \over m_1+m_2+\dots}$$ and in terms of total mass $$M\vec{v}_{cm} = m_1\vec{v}_1+m_2\vec{v}_2\dots = \vec{P}$$[[the total momentum is equal to the total mass times the velocity of the center of mass]].

[[in the absence of external forces, the momentum of the center of mass is conserved]]

#Caution Both #C11-E 11.74 and #C8-E 8.100 illustrate the extreme importance of choosing a simplifying [[coordinate system]].
