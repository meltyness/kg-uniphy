The [[kinematics of rigid bodies|translational motion]] and [[kinematics of rotational motion of rigid bodies|rotational motion]] should be combined due to the [[energy]] model.

The causes of motion of rigid bodies are governed by the following [[formula|formulas]]:

#### ... with [[externality|external forces]]
Taking the derivative of both sides gives $$M\vec{a}_{cm}=m_1\vec{a}_1+m_2\vec{a}_2\dots$$ So we model the object $\sum \vec{F} = \sum \vec{F}_{ext} + \sum \vec{F}_{int}=M\vec{a}_{cm}$ and due to [[Newton's third law of motion]], $\sum \vec{F}_{int}=\vec{0}$. So $$\sum \vec{F}_{ext}=M\vec{a}_{cm}={d\vec{P} \over dt}$$
#### ... with acting [[torque]]
[[Newton's second law of motion]] [[Newton's law for rotational forces|for rotational forces]] applied
In the language of torque we have the relation (which can be derived from NSL, [[kinematics of rotational motion of rigid bodies#Kinematics|rotational kinematics]], notice this depends on the axis-definition.
$$\sum \tau = I_{cm} \alpha$$ 

#### ... with the [[kinetic energy of a rigid body]]
A rigid body has kinetic energy with $$K = \frac{1}{2}Mv_{cm}^2+\frac{1}{2}I_{cm}\omega^2$$

#### ... with [[angular momentum]]
In addition to the above, we also have that [[angular collision]] may occur, when considering the action of gears
