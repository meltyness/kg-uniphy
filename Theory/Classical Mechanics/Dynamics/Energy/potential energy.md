#### Definition
In the context of [[law of conservation of energy]] the amount of energy stored in a system.

An important subtlety lies in the understanding of [[externality]] of any action, as well as the fact that [[energy is a property of systems not objects]] #LanguageNote 

#### [[formula]]
The [[work]] done by a [[conservative force, field]] is given $$W=-\Delta U$$
Over a small displacement $$F_x(x)\Delta x=-\Delta U \ \ \ \ \text{and} \ \ \ \ \ F_x(x)=-{\Delta U \over \Delta x}$$
Therefore taking the limit we arrive at the following relationship:
$$F_x(x) = -{dU(x) \over dx}$$
Hence, [[a conservative force always pushes a system toward lower potential energy]].

... for a [[field]],

$$F_x = {-\partial U \over \partial x} \ \ \ \ \ F_y = {-\partial U \over \partial y} \ \ \ \ \ F_z = {-\partial U \over \partial z}$$
$$\vec{F}=-({-\partial U \over \partial x}\hat{i}+{-\partial U \over \partial y}\hat{j}+ {-\partial U \over \partial z}\hat{k})$$
