#### Definition
A [[rigid body]] can be thought of as being composed of [[motion|moving]], [[mass|massive]] [[particle|elements]], and its [[kinetic energy]] based on the [[law of conservation of energy]] corresponds to the sum of the energy [[isolated system|of its components]].

Consider that each particle of a system has kinetic energy, what's clear is that the kinetic energy in total of the particles is simply the sum of their individual kinetic energies, however taken [[relative velocity|in terms of the motion of the center of mass]], more complications are posed. 

See #C8-E Number 8.89 for demonstrating KE in terms of $v_{cm}$.

#### [[formula]]
In general, a rigid body has Kinetic Energy with, $$K = \frac{1}{2}Mv_{cm}^2+\frac{1}{2}I_{cm}\omega^2$$
#### In rotational motion
The $i$th [[particle]] of a [[rigid body]] rotating about a fixed axis can be written with kinetic energy $$\frac{1}{2}m_iv_i^2 = \frac{1}{2}m_ir_i^2\omega^2 $$
In total, $$K = \sum_i \frac{1}{2}m_ir_i^2\omega^2$$
And by factoring out $\omega^2 / 2$, we arrive at the definition of [[moment of inertia]] $$I=\sum_im_ir_i^2$$
[[the kinetic energy of a rigid body varies with the inertia and the angular speed]]

and in those terms $$K=\frac{1}{2}I\omega^2$$
