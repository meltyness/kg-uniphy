#### Performing [[work]] and [[power]]
Using [[displacement]] and that [[the arc length of a circle with given radius through a given angle is their product]], the most general [[formula]] is:
$$W = \int_{\theta_1}^{\theta_2} \tau_z \ d\theta \ \ \ \ \text{(work done by torque)}$$
And in the special case of constant torque,
$$W = \tau_z(\theta_2-\theta_1) \ \ \ \ \ \text{(constant torque)}$$
and in terms of [[kinetic energy of a rigid body|the kinetic energy]], using a [[derivation]] similar to that used in [[kinetic energy#Formula|this article]] to find the [[work-energy theorem]], $$W_\text{tot} = \int_{\omega_1}^{\omega_2} = I \omega_z \ d\omega_z=\frac{1}{2}I\omega_z^2 - \frac{1}{2}I\omega_z^2$$ and finally we have that power is $$P={dW\over dt}=\tau_z{d\theta\over dt}=\tau_z\omega_z$$
