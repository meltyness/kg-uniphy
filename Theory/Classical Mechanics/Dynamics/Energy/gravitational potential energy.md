#C7-1 

#### Definition
A [[mechanical system]] with a [[rigid body|body]] [[work|moved a displacement]] against [[surface gravity]] of the [[earth, atmosphere, water, and wildlife]] has had the gravitational potential energy changed.

#### [[formula]]
$$U_{\text{grav}} = mgy$$
We'll also have that, on earth, for a given distance, since [[gravitational interaction]] is a [[conservative force, field]]:
#C12-3
$$U(r)=-G{m_Em_2 \over r}$$
Which leads to a concept of [[escape speed]]
