### Definition
A [[particle]] with [[mass]] and [[velocity]] can be said to have an intrinsic amount of [[energy]], as a [[scalar quantity]].

### [[formula]]
Finding a [[derivation]] for this [[physical quantities|quantity]] given [[kinematics along a straight line#with Constant Acceleration|constant acceleration motion,]] [[displacement]] as $x-x_0=s$
$$
      v_f^2=v_0^2+2as \implies a={{v_f^2-v_0^2} \over 2s}$$ Relating to a [[force]] via [[Newton's second law of motion]], $$F = ma = \frac{1}{2}{{mv_f^2-mv_0^2} \over s}$$ So that $$Fs = \frac{1}{2}mv_f^2 - \frac{1}{2}mv_0^2$$
Therefore we take kinetic energy of a particle to be $$K=\frac{1}{2}mv^2$$
#### [[Work-Energy Theorem]]
We also have the following:$$W_{\text{tot}}=K_f-K_0=\Delta K$$

#### Extended to [[rigid body|Rigid Bodies]]
A rigid body also has kinetic energy, as discussed in [[kinetic energy of a rigid body]]

#### ... for a [[particle]],
Solving for energy as a function of momentum, $$E={p^2 \over 2m}$$
