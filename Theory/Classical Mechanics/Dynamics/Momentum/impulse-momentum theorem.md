#### Definition
[[The change in momentum of a particle during a time interval equals the impulse of the net force that acts on the particle during that interval]].

#### [[formula]]
From the definitions of [[duration]], [[impulse]],
$$\vec{J} = \sum{\vec{F}}(t_2-t_1)=\sum \vec{F}\Delta t$$
 [[momentum]], and [[Newton's second law of motion]]: $$\sum\vec{F}={d\vec{p} \over dt}$$
... and written in terms of [[average momentum]] $$\sum\vec{F} = {p_2 - p_1 \over t_2 - t_1}$$Gives: $$\vec{J} = \vec{p_2} - \vec{p_1}$$
