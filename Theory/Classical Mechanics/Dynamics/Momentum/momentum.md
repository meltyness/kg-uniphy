#KeyConcept 

#### Definition
Momentum is a [[vector quantity]] that can be used alongside [[impulse]] in order to describe interactions between bodies.

Momentum is [[conservation|conserved]] based on [[law of conservation of momentum]].

The plural of momentum is "momenta." #LanguageNote

Historically, this was how the second law was defined, "quantity of motion."

#### Applicable Laws
[[impulse-momentum theorem]]

#### Specific Considerations
- This is subject to [[relative velocity]] and since it is based on [[Newton's second law of motion]] it is also subject to the constraint that it requires an [[inertial frame of reference]].

#### [[formula]]
Specifically, the "linear momentum" is given: 
$$\vec{p} = m\vec{v} \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \sum\vec{F}={d\vec{p}\over dt}$$
#WaitWhat is non-linear momentum? #GotIt [[angular momentum]].

#### Discussion of Units
Momentum has [[SI units]]:
$$\text{kg Â· m/s}$$

#### [[derivation]]
The significance can be seen by reformulating [[Newton's second law of motion]].

$$\sum\vec{F}=m{d\vec{v} \over dt}={d \over dt}[m\vec{v}]$$
