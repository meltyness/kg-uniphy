#KeyConcept 

The tendency for motion to remain constant, or to resist change.

#WaitWhat How does "remain constant" differ from "resist change" -- can we be thorough about the theoretical analysis here?

### [[inertial frame of reference|Inertial]] [[reference frame|Frames of Reference]]
An intertial frame (or, approximately intertial frame) may not have any [[acceleration]].

So, we strategically [[take cases]]

An accelerated reference frame $F$, an observer, $O$ and a non-accelerated body $B$ 

- Observing from the accelerated reference frame, $O$ may [[employ deductive reasoning|conclude]] that the $B$ is indeed accelerating
- Observing from an intertial frame (either outside the system, or as $B$) $O$ concludes that $F$ is accelerating and $B$ is [[at rest]].

#### Extending validity to other frames
If we have two bodies with constant [[relative velocity]], $$\vec{v}_{P/A} = \vec{v}_{P/B} + \vec{v}_{B/A}=\vec{c}$$
then an observer of $P$ in either $A$ or $B$ observes that [[Newton's first law of motion|the law of intertia]] is obeyed.
