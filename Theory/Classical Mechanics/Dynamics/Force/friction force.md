#C5-3

Friction force resists the application of a push or pull when in contact with a surface.

An apparently limiting case of friction force is [[fluid resistance]]

These #17thCentury suppositions are also called [Amonton's laws of friction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guillaume_Amontons#Amontons'_laws_of_friction)

#### Static Friction [[formula]]
When an [[rigid body|object]] is [[at rest|not moving]] this type of friction is experienced.

The following is a representative [[models|model]]:
$\mu_s$ is a [[unitless]] number, $n$ is the magnitude of the [[normal force]].
$$f_k = \mu_k n$$
$$f_s \le \mu_s n$$

#### Kinetic Friction
When an object is moving this type of friction is experienced.


The following is a representative [[models|model]]:
$\mu_k$ is a [[unitless]] number, $n$ is the magnitude of the [[normal force]].
$$f_k = \mu_k n$$

#### Rolling Friction
$\mu_r$ values of $0.002, 0.003$ for railroads, $0.01, 0.02$ for car tires. This is a type of [[constraints]].

#C10-3 further elucidates that deformable bodies effect [[dynamics of rigid bodies]]:
- The road or tire deforms creating a larger surface area for friction
- The direction of the [[normal force]] changes producing a [[torque]] opposing motion

#### ... for [[fluid flow]] and [[viscosity]]
In [[fluid mechanics]] this is a form of internal friction.
