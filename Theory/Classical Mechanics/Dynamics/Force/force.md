#KeyConcept 

### Definition
An [[interaction]] between two [[rigid body|bodies]], or a [[rigid body|body]] and its [[environment]].

Force is a [[vector quantity]], since this interaction can happen in different directions.

Forces from one body onto another are called [[externality|external]]

### Types of Forces
- [[contact force]]
- [[long-range force]]
- [[fundamental forces]]
- [[pressure]]
- [[weight]]
- [[impulse]]
- [[torque]]

#### [[energy]] disposition
- [[conservative force, field]]
- [[dissipative force]]

#### [[alternative formulation]]
- [[central force]]
- [[fictitious force]] #WaitWhat who's got a good definition of this?
- [[generalized force|virtual force]]
- [[generalized force]]
- [[real force]] this is in the context of [[Lagrangian formulation]]

### Applicable Laws
[[Newton's laws of motion]] 

### [[superposition of forces]]
Forces add up through simple [[vector quantity#Vector sum|addition]]

### [[formula]]
$\vec{F} = m\vec{a}$

Where $m$ represents [[mass]] and $\vec{a}$ represents [[acceleration]]

### Discussion of Units
A force is measured by "how much" the force pushes or pulls, and the [[SI units]] is the [[newton]]. 

May be [[experiment or measurement|measured]] using a [[spring balance]]
