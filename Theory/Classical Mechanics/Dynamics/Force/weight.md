#### Definition
[[the weight of a body is the total gravitational force exerted on the body by all other bodies in the universe]]

### Discussion of Units
Weight results from the [[gravitational interaction]] near the [[earth, atmosphere, water, and wildlife]]'s surface.

Characterized by the [[formula]] $w = mg$, or $\vec{w} = m \vec{g}$

Due to [[surface gravity#Variability]] weight generally is variable, but [[mass]] is not... an important distinction. Weight also varies from planet to planet.

### [[experiment or measurement|Measurement]]
We can use a [[balance scale]] to determine if two bodies have the same weight, and therefore same mass.

#### [[derivation]] of [[apparent weight]]
In general weight refers to the force due to [[gravitational interaction]], which varies with [[displacement]].
