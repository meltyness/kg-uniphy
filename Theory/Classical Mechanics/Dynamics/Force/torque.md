#### Definition
The [[kinematics of rotational motion of rigid bodies|twisting or turning]] motion related to the [[force]] that caused them, as measured relative to a specific [[position]].

A force applied further from the [[axis]] is more effective with [[displacement|distance]].

The torque is the force [[tangent]] to the axis, only as opposed to the [[axial]] or [[radial]] components.

#### ... [[formula]]
$\tau = Fl$ provides: 

- $\tau$ : torque or [[moment]]
- $F$ : amount of force applied
- $l$ : the distance of the moment arm / lever arm
	- Consider that for a [[rigid body]] this may be taken from the [[center of mass]].
	- Implicit in this, is a line of action, of the force, and a point from which the torque is being measured -- if the line of action is such that the lever arm is zero, then the torque is zero

And in general for an [[externality|external force]], $$\vec{\tau} = \vec{r} \times \vec{F}$$
This leads to the concept of the [[cheater (lever for plumber)]].

#### Discussion of Units
Like [[work]], torque is a product of [[force]] and [[displacement|distance]], however torque is a [[vector quantity]] and it is defined using the [[there exists a vector cross product relating three vectors|cross product]]. 

Torque has units of $$1\text{ N Â· m}$$ wheras work is taken in the [[joule]].

In order to take [[torque and work, power, energy]] we find that we multiply only by a dimensionless quantity, the [[radian]], which is the best way to think about the units. 

#### [[Newton's second law of motion]] [[Newton's law for rotational forces|for rotational forces]] applied
In the language of torque we have the relation (which can be derived from NSL, [[kinematics of rotational motion of rigid bodies#Kinematics|rotational kinematics]],
$$\sum \tau = I_{cm} \alpha$$ 
#### In general, for axes in [[translational]] motion
#C10-3 
With $\sum F = Ma_{cm}$ translational forces, and:
- $z$: an axis through the [[center of mass]]
	- The axis is an axis of symmetry #WaitWhat is the converse here?
	- The axis must not change direction
	- The axis *need not* however, be [[at rest]] or be an [[inertial frame of reference]], since clearly $a_{cm}$ 
- $\tau_z$: the net torque about an axis
- $I_{cm}$: ~~the~~ a [[moment of inertia]] through the [[center of mass]]
- $\alpha_z$: the [[angular acceleration]] about the axis

We have an application of [[Newton's second law of motion]]:
$$\sum\tau_z = I_{cm}\alpha_z$$
