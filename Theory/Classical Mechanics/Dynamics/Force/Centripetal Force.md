#C5-4

#Caution only use the [[force]] $m\frac{v^2}{R}$ on the $m\vec{a}$ side of $\sum\vec{F}$ 

This appears as a [[fictitious force]] or the [[coriolis effect]].

Consider #C10-E 10.70 as an example of a [[loop-the-loop]], where the forces acting on the ball are taken to be the desired motion with [[formula]] for the [[free-body diagram]]: $$\sum F = m\frac{v^2}{R} = F_g - \hat{n}$$
The alternative, if you take $v_{\text{top}}=0$ is an obviously-incorrect condition -- if $v_\text{top}=0$ and the only force experienced is [[surface gravity]], the ping-pong ball, train simply falls out of the loop.
