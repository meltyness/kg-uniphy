As a model this [[break down the kinds of behavior into a well-characterized component]].

### Key Procedures
- [[Newton's first law of motion]], and [[Newton's second law of motion]] apply to a single body.
- Only forces acting on the body, $A$ under consideration matter, so in the [[action-reaction pair]] only consider $\vec{F}_\text{B onto A}$.
- A free-body diagram includes only such forces, [[externality|external]] and onto $A$.

For each [[force]] answer:
- What actor is applying this force?

For each [[rigid body|body]]:
- Draw a separate diagram
-
