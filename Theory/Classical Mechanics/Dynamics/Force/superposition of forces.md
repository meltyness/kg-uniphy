### Superposition
[[forces on a body have the same effect equal to their sum]]

So a resultant force has the [[formula]] $$\vec{R} = \sum_{i=1}^n {F_i}$$
Note that this implies that forces can be written as the superposition of their component values. As such a new notation is introduced on [[free-body diagram|force diagrams]] whereby a squiggly line over $\vec{F}$ indicates that it has been broken out into $\vec{F}_x, \vec{F}_y \dots$ 

This leads to another principle assertion that, [[zero net force is equivalent to no force at all]]
