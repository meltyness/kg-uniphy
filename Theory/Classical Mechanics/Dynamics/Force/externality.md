#KeyConcept

### External
Introduced in #C4-3, a [[force]] is external to a body via a completely intuitive definition.

#### Defined
Forces exerted externally to a body means that other bodies in the environment are exerting the forces.

#WaitWhat [[It's impossible for a body to affect its own motion by exerting force on itself]]; if it were possible, you could lift yourself up to the ceiling by pulling up on your own belt! #GotIt See: [[motion of rigid bodies]].
