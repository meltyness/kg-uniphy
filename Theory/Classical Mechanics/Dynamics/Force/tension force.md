#C4-1 

#### Definition
A pulling exerted on an object by a rope, cord, etc. often [[mechanical system]] [[constraints]].

#Caution Note this is important because the tension of a rope can only be considered in terms of who the force is acting on -- not in terms of the rope itself

#Caution Dear you, you can also assume too little knowledge about tension... make sure that you look at the [[action-reaction pair]] of each body.
