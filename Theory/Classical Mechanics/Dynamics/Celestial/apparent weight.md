#C12-7

Similar to dealing with a [[loop-the-loop]], we take [[earth, atmosphere, water, and wildlife]] [[radius]] to be $R_E$ and find the following [[formula]] relationship:

$$w=w_0-{mv^2\over R_E}$$

which can demonstrate that [[surface gravity]] varies by $$\pm {0.0339 \over 2} \text{ m/s}^2$$
and by an angle $$\beta \le 0.1^\circ$$
