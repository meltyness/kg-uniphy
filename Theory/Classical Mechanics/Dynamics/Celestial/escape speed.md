#C12-2 

In the context of [[gravitational interaction]] and [[rocket propulsion]]. A type of [[speed limit]].

To find this apply [[law of conservation of energy]] and [[assume the maximum possible|take]] $r\rightarrow \infty$ for the gravitational potential energy in the second [[states|state]].

A [[formula]] is given by $$v_i = \sqrt{2GM \over R}$$
