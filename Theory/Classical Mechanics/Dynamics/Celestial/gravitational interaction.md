#C1-2

### Basic Description
Two [[particle|particles]] in [[space]] with [[mass]] undergo [[attraction]] and [[acceleration]] towards one another.

#### [[formula]]
A [[conservative force, field]], the [[potential energy|potential]] is given by the product of the [[gravitational constant]]: $$U(r)=-G{m_1m_2 \over r}$$and it follows that for $i=x,y,z$ $$F_i = {-Gm_1m_2i \over {(x^2+y^2+z^2)^{\frac{3}{2}}}}$$ #Warning this forms an [[action-reaction pair]]

- [[Newton's law of gravitation]]
- [[surface gravity]]
- [[weight]]
