#C12-8

For [[stars|the sun]], $M=1.99 \times 10^{30} \text{ kg}$, $R=6.96\times 10^8 \text{ m}$ are much larger than [[earth, atmosphere, water, and wildlife]] or any [[planet]].

We can find a [[mass density]], $\rho=M/V\approx 1410 \text{ kg/m}^3$

To find an [[escape speed]] we'd find the [[formula]] $$v=\sqrt{8\pi G\rho \over 3}R\approx6.18\times10^5\text{ m/s}$$
So if the sun were the same [[mass density]], but 500x larger, the escape velocity would exceed the [[speed of light]].

Theorized as a result of [[crossing two composite physical quantities]]

#### Finding the [[Schwarzschild radius]]
[[luck out on a set of compensating errors|Two compensating errors cancel]]
- The kinetic energy of [[electromagnetic waves and light]] is not with [[mass-energy equivalence]] $mc^2/2$
- The [[gravitational potential energy]] of a black hole, is not the same as from [[Newton's law of gravitation]]

We indeed have $$R_S = {2GM \over c^2}$$
