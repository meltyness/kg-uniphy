#### ... composition and [[earthquakes]]
The presence of extremely large [[pressure]], and [[temperature]] permits subsurface earth to produce [[uranium]] in [[atomic speciation, nuclides, isotope]] that have a short [[nuclear lifetime]], and the [[radioactivity]] and [[nuclear decay]] results in large-scale physical instablity in earthquakes [[hypotheses]].

#### ...the [[radius]]
Earth has the following:
$$R_E \approx 6380 \text{ km}$$
With this and the value of $G$ measured via [[Cavendish balance]], $$m_E = {gR_E^2 \over G} \approx 5.98 \times 10^{24} \text{ kg}$$
[[in terms of energy, low earth orbit is halfway to the edge of the universe]]

Variations between:
- average [[mass density]] of earth based on its [[gravitational interaction]]
- measured [[mass density]] of rocks near the crust

can be used to show that the [[mass density]] of the earth is variable so that more knowledge about the [[tectonic plates]] can potentially help to predict [[tsunami]], for example.

Planets such as earth orbit, [[stars]].

#### ...the [[electric field]] and [[net charge]], and [[magnetic field]]
The $\vec{E}$ near the surface of earth is $\approx 150N/C$ pointing towards the center (slightly negative).

The $\vec{B}$ near the surface derived from IGRF $\approx 45 \ \mu\text{T}$

#### dry [[adiabatic]] lapse rate
The change in the temperature of the air in the atmosphere is described approximately as an adiabatic process. The flow of the air is much faster than the diffusion rate of intermolecular collisions transmitting the thermal energy. Follows from modeling the [[air]] nearest the heated ground, receiving [[heat radiation and absorption, thermal radiation]] as a [[parcel]] with varying [[pressure]], therefore an adiabatic process.

#### ...[[derivation]] of [[formula]] for the [[pressure]] of [[earth's atmosphere]]
The variation of [[pressure]] with [[height]] occurse with the following

- First applying [[Pascal's law]] for [[gravitational potential energy]], 
$${dp \over dy} = -\rho g$$
- ... and [[ideal gas law]] for a [[mass density]] $$\rho = {pM \over RT}$$
- So assuming [[surface gravity]], [[isothermically]], and constant [[molar mass]] (i.e., [[kind of material|composition]])$$ \int{dp' \over p'} = -{Mg \over RT}\int_0^h dy$$
- Gives that pressure varies with $${p_2 \over p_1} = e^{-Mg(y_2-y_1)/RT}$$
- Take $M\approx(28.8 \times 10^{-3})$, up to about $10 \text{ km}$
