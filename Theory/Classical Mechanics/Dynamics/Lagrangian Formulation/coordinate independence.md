"When all but one of the generalized coordinates are fixed, there remains a continuous range of values for that one coordinate."

In the context of [[Lagrangian Kinematics]], 
- consider the disposition of [[pendulums]], 
	- one may be tempted to write the situation as having 2 [[degrees of freedom]] because both the $x$ and $y$ coordinates could be [[what can be measured|measured]], 
	- but without recognizing that due to the presented [[constraints]], namely the tethered mass, with constant [[radius]] $y$ nor $x$ can be meaningfully fixed

Therefore a pendulum only has 1 degree of freedom, $\partial \theta$, which could also conceivably be written $\partial s$ for the [[arc length]], but this would complicate writing the [[generalized force]] on the system.
