#Custom-1 

A [[variational principle]] part of [[variational calculus]] which relates the [[path]] to a construct called the [[action functional]] which is composed of the [[Lagrangian]] which defines that [[thermodynamic state|configuration]] of the system.

Derived from
- [[principle of virtual work]] in equilibrium, a virtual displacement has zero work done.
- [[principle of minimum potential energy]] in equilibrium, energy is minimized

Stated as a principle,

[[The path taken by the system through a duration, and state change is the path for which the action is stationary, to first-order]]

#### [[derivation]]
From the [[work-energy theorem]], a [[state change]] is described in terms of [[externality|external]] [[conservative force, field|non-conservative]] [[force]] applied, which leads to $$\partial K + \partial U - \partial W_\text{ext} = 0$$
But this introduces special constraints for the [[kinematics]] with which we are [[models|describing systems]]. See [[Lagrangian Kinematics]]

and so with the concepts of [[generalized force]], and [[generalized coordinates]] well-defined, in general we have $$\partial W_\text{ext}=\sum F_i\cdot\partial r_i(\partial q_1, \partial q_2, \dots) = \sum Q_j\partial q_j$$
