#Custom-1

The [[Lagrange equations]] apply the [[stationary-action principle]] to the [[Lagrangian]] of a [[mechanical system]] and its [[constraints]], as permitted by [[Lagrangian Kinematics]].

Note also this depends on [[dynamic equilibrium]] #WaitWhat #GotIt 

#WaitWhat how would one use the lagrangian formulation to derive the [[wave equation]]?

#### Relevant terms
[[constraints]] - An interdependency between two [[degrees of freedom]].
[[coordinate independence]] - A claim of non-interdependency
[[coordinate completness]] - 
[[dynamic equilibrium]]
[[Holonomic systems]]
[[principle of virtual work]]
[[virtual force]]
[[generalized force]]
[[Lagrange equations]]
[[Lagrangian]]
