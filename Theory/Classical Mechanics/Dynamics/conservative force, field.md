#KeyConcept 

### Definition
A conservative [[force]] acts such that its total [[work]] has:

1. The force can be represented as a difference between the intitial values of a potential-energy function

#WaitWhat what in nature violates this?

2. It is reversible
3. It is independent of the path of the body and depends only on the starting and ending points.
4. When the starting and ending points are the same, the total work is zero

#### ... in the case of a [[field]]
The existence of a path such that $$\oint\vec{G}\cdot d\vec{l} \ne 0$$ negates that the hypothetical field, $\vec{G}$, can be conservative.
