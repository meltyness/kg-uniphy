#### Definition
A type of [[velocity]] in [[kinematics of rotational motion of rigid bodies]]

#### [[formula|Formulas]]
We also define [[angular velocity]] $$\omega_z = \lim_{\Delta t \rightarrow 0}{\Delta \theta \over \Delta t} = {d\theta \over dt}$$
[[at any instant, every part of a rotating rigid body has the same angular velocity]]

#ThumbRule $$\text{1 rad / s} \approx \text{10 RPM}$$
##### As a [[vector quantity]]
$\vec{\omega}$ is directed along the axis of rotation, with the aforementioned discussion of $d\theta \over dt$.

##### [[angular acceleration]]
It's given $$\alpha_z = \lim_{\Delta t \rightarrow 0}{\Delta \omega_z \over \Delta t} = {d\omega_z \over dt}$$
###### ... as a vector
If the axis isn't changing, $\vec{\alpha}$ has the same [[angle]] as $\vec{\omega}$.

From #9-E we have the following useful result for a point on the rotation object: 
$$\vec{v} = \vec{\omega} \times \vec{r}$$
and that $$\vec{a}_\text{rad}=\vec{w}\times\vec{v}=\vec{\omega}\times(\vec{\omega}\times\vec{r})$$
