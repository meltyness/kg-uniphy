When we discount [[fluid resistance|air resistance]] and consider only [[surface gravity]], discounting [[Newton's law of gravitation|gravity, like the tidal force]] we can construct the motion of a projectile with a simple parabola.

It's [[path]] is called a trajectory, which exists on a specific plane of motion.

#### Principle
[[we can regard projectile motion as a combination of constant horizontal and accelerated vertical motion]]

#### Flat-earth Approximation
Given the following variables:
- $x$ : [[position]] along the $x$-axis
- $y$ : [[position]] along the $y$-axis
	- (alternatively, [[displacement]] from an origin)
	- collectively, a [[vector quantity]] representing [[position]]
	- These can be considered independently.
- $v_0$ : [[time|inital]] [[velocity]] [[scalar quantity|magnitude]]
- $\alpha_0$ : the angle relative to earth of $\vec{v}_0$
	- Initial velocity, is a vector, but to help with interpreting the kinematic equations, we write it like this.
- $g$ : equal to $-a_y$, represents the acceleration towards earth due to gravity
- $t$ : represents where we expect the projectile to be along the trajectory at a certain time.

We have the following [[formula]]:
- $x=(v_0\cos \alpha_0)t$
- $y = (v_0 \sin \alpha_0)t - \frac{1}{2}gt^2$
- $v_x = (v_0\cos\alpha_0)$
- $v_y = (v_0\sin\alpha_0)-gt$

There's a number of manipulations we can make.
- Write the displacement magnitude
- Write the speed
- Write the angle of velocity
- Write the $y$ coordinate in terms of the $x$ coordinate
