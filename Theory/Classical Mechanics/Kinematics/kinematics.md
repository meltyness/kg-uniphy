#KeyConcept 

### Definition
Describes [[motion]].

### [[kinematics along a straight line]]
Choose a [[coordinate system]] for a [[particle]] $B$ and it's [[position]], $x_i$ to travel along a straight-line path.

We choose the $x\text{-axis}$ with origin $O$ positive, along the direction of motion.

### [[kinematics in space]]
We extend the notion of [[position]], [[velocity]] to incorporate all components.

### [[kinematics of a projectile]]
When we discount [[fluid resistance|air resistance]] and consider only [[surface gravity]] we can construct the motion of a projectile with a simple parabola.

### [[kinematics of circular motion]]
Some objects, very large like [[planet|planets]], and very small like [[particle|particles]] are apparently predisposed to fairly precisely circular motion.

#### [[kinematics of rigid bodies]]
A [[rigid body]] is composed of [[particle]] and can move

### [[kinematics of rotational motion of rigid bodies]]
[[motion of rigid bodies]] can be rotational

### [[satellite motion]]
Also describes kinematics, in the case where the trajectory is elliptical.

#### ... [[the motion of light, and light propagation]]
Describe [[electromagnetic waves and light]]

#### ... [[quantum kinematics]]
Describes how [[material particles exhibit wave-like behaviors]]
