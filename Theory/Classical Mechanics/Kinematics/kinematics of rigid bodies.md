#KeyConcept 

Taken in terms of [[center of mass]], [[rigid body]] [[motion]] is quite similar to [[kinematics in space|motion in space]]

Consider that for each [[particle]] composing the [[mechanical system]] we may take something like the [[relative velocity]] to the [[velocity]] of the [[center of mass]]. See [[motion of rigid bodies]] for more details.

$$v_i' = v_i - v_{cm}$$

[[every possible motion of a rigid body can be represented as a combination of translational motion of the center of mass and rotation about an axis through the center of mass]]

In general we use the following, however,
- [[motion of rigid bodies]]
- [[kinematics of rotational motion of rigid bodies]]

A complete description of this type of motion is #OutOfScope

#### [[center of mass]]
For $i$ particles with masses $m_i$ each positioned at $\vec{r}_i$ the center of mass [[formula|is]]:
$$\vec{r}_{cm} = {\sum_i{m_i\vec{r}_i} \over\sum_i m_i}$$
Similar logic leads to $$M\vec{v}_{cm} = m_1\vec{v}_1+m_2\vec{v}_2\dots = \vec{P}$$

#### [[kinematics of rotational motion of rigid bodies]]
Before codifying the concept of a [[rigid body]] we'll start thinking about how they move.

[[When a body or a collection of particles is acted on by external forces, the center of mass moves just as though all the mass were concentrated at that point and it were acted on by a net force equal to the sum of the external forces on the system]].

#### [[rolling]]
A rigid body [[rolling]] has certain implications wrt the $v_{cm}, \omega$ parameters of motion established, namely $$v_{cm} = R\omega$$ implies rolling without slipping.

#Caution [Coin rotation paradox - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coin_rotation_paradox) you can walk into some analytical perils.

[[derivation]] of the coin paradox from this definition. 

Take rotating circle, with radius $R$, and rotated circle with radius $\hat{R}$.
