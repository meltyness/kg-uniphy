### Description
The [[velocity]] as [[experiment or measurement|measured]] by an observer, a [[physical quantities]].

When describing, observing, and predicting a [[physical systems]] circumstances we must confirm where an observer is to predict their observations. An observer, and [[motion]] always reside within a [[reference frame]]. Since [[energy]], [[momentum]], [[angular velocity]], and [[angular momentum]] each depend on this

[[Galileo Galilei|also known as the Galilean velocity transformation]]

### [[formula]]
#### Relative Position
When moving from one reference frame to another, use: $$\vec{x}_{P/A} = \vec{x}_{P/B} + \vec{x}_{B/A}$$
The distance from $A$ to point $P$ is the distance from $A$'s [[origin]] to $B$'s origin plus the distance from $B$'s origin to $P$.

#### Relative Velocity
The velocity of $P$ in $B$ as observed from $A$ is $$\vec{v}_{P/A}=\vec{v}_{P/B}+\vec{v}_{B/A}$$
So the sum of the change in position of $P$ in $B$, and the change in position of $A$ vs $B$.

Use this notation, since it corresponds with fraction cancelling for moving [[degrees of freedom|through arbitrarily many reference frames]]. 

The [[range of validity]] for this fails close to the [[speed of light]].
