#### Definition
About some [[at rest|fixed]] [[axis symmetric|axis]] within an [[inertial frame of reference]], we can simply describe [[kinematics of circular motion|rotational motion]] of a [[rigid body]].

#### Notation
We choose $\theta$ to describe the [[angle]] that an arm makes with an [[axis]].

The arc [[length]] of a sector of that [[circle]] is given $s = r\theta$, namely [[the arc length of a circle with given radius through a given angle is their product]]

[[radians]] are defined such that the arc is the same length as the radius, it also follows that $$\text{1 rad} = {360^\circ \over {2 \pi}}$$
We also rely on [[angular velocity]]'s definition.

#### [[formula]]
These are fairly intuitive relative to [[kinematics along a straight line|typical kinematic equations]]

#Caution these only apply for constant angular acceleration.
$$\omega_z = \omega_{0z} + \alpha_zt \ \ \ \text{(constant angular acceleration)}$$
$$\theta-\theta_0=\omega_{0z}t+\frac{1}{2}\alpha_zt^2 \ \ \ \text{(constant angular acceleration)}$$
$$\omega_z^2 = \omega_{0z}^2+2\alpha_z(\theta - \theta_0)  \ \ \ \text{(constant angular acceleration)}$$
At a [[particle|point]] a distance $r$ from the axis of rotation, when [[rolling]], the [[speed]] is$$v = r\omega$$ and the point's [[kinematics of circular motion#Nonuniform Circular Motion|tangential acceleration]] is given by the relationship $$a_\text{tan}={dv \over dt}=r{d \omega \over dt} = r \alpha$$
and radial acceleration per usual $$a_\text{rad} = {v^2 \over r} = \omega^2 r$$
