### Discussion
A [[dissipative force]] in an [[periodic motion and oscillation|oscillation]] results in a decrease in [[amplitude]] during the duration.

Note this goes through several [[material]] considerations, such a [[flutter]], see [Aeroelasticity - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeroelasticity#Flutter) for more details. [[smoke generator]], and [[yarn tufts]]

#### [[fluid resistance]]
A fluid resistance gives a situation with this [[differential equations]], and three solutions presented below  $$\sum F_x=ma_x =m{d^2x \over dt^2}  = -kx -bv_x$$
and [[energy]] following 
$$E=\frac{1}{2}mv_x^2+\frac{1}{2}kx^2$$

so that $${dE \over dt} = mv_x{dv_x \over dt} + kx{dx \over dt}=v_x(ma_x+kx)$$
and applying the original system dynamics $$=-bv_x^2$$

##### [[underdamping]]
For very little damping, we get a "squeezed" oscillatory behavior, gives the following [[formula]]:
$$x=Ae^{-b/2m}t\cos(\omega't+\phi)$$
$$\omega' = \sqrt{{k\over m} - {b^2 \over 4m^2}}$$

##### [[Critical damping]]
No oscillation occurs when $$b=2\sqrt{km}$$
##### [[overdamping]]
When overdamped we get non-oscillatory dynamics like, which take longer to fall than with critical damping $$x=C_1e^{-a_1t}+C_2e^{-a_2t}$$
