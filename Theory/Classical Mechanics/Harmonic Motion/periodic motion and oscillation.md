#### Discussion
This is undergone by [[spring-mass systems]] and [[pendulums]].

#### ... [[oscillatory kinematics]]
Choose the [[origin]], $O$ as the [[equilibrium]] position.

Then the position of the mass, $x$ is the [[displacement]], and hence useful in the context of [[spring force]], $F=-kx$.

A [[restoring force]] always results in oscillation.

The [[formula]] for [[angular frequency]] is $$\omega = 2\pi f$$
and a relationship between [[frequency]] and [[oscillatory period]] is $$f = {1 \over T}$$
#### ... [[simple harmonic motion]]
This is the case where [[amplitude]] and [[frequency]] are independent. We have primarily that, $$x=A\cos(\omega t + \phi)$$
#### ... [[dampened oscillation]]
When the [[restoring force]] varies down, or the amount of [[energy]] is not [[conservation|conserved]] we'll find different behaviors.

#### ... [[forced oscillation]]
When there is a [[driving force]]
