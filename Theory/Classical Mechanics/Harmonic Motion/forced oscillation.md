#C13-8

#### Discussion
Under a [[driving force]] to a [[dampened oscillation]] we arrive at this type of [[motion]].

This can be [[disaster|disastrous]] in the context of [[aerodynamics]]

#### [[formula]]
Take a [[driving force]] $F(t) = F_\text{max}\cos(\omega_d t)$ there is a [[response curve]] with a [[resonance|sharp peak]] at $\omega_d = \omega$ for light damping, which vanishes for stronger damping, and we also have: $$A = {F_\text{max} \over \sqrt{(k-m\omega_d^2)^2 + b^2\omega_d^2}}$$
#### [[power]] extraction
When using a device to power, say, a vehicle consider the following (adapted from #C13-E, 13.63 SHM in a Car Engine)

If the system is perfectly efficient the [[kinetic energy]] of the piston is stripped at the end, and maximized again, at the center. So the work being done by the [[combustion engine]] onto the piston is this quarter of the [[oscillatory period]], and this is suitable for the power. 

So it did $KE=\frac{1}{2}mv^2$ worth of $W$ over the course of $T/4$, $P=4W/T$.
