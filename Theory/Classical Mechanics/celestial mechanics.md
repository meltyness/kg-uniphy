#C12-5

[[planet]] - comes from a Greek word meaning "wanderer" $$\text{περιπλανώμενος 
  (periplanómenos)}$$
[[stars]] - "to burn"

[[nebula]]

#### Discussion
The realization that [[planets move in the sky relative to the stars]] combined with the realization that [[earth is a planet]], [[all planets orbit the sun]], [[the motion of the planets as seen from the earth can precisely determine their orbits]]

[[Copernicus]] realized that:
- [[earth is a planet]]
- [[all planets orbit the sun]]

[[Kepler]] wrote down [[Kepler's laws]] a set of [[empirical laws]]

The properties of these equations can be used to detect a [[stellar wobble]] predicted by the discussion of [[Newton's law of gravitation]] where an [[visible|invisible]] planet causes a small [[stellar wobble]] to the offset of the [[center of mass]] of the whole system.

An [[astronomical unit]] is $\approx 149,600,000 \text{ km}$ the distance between [[earth, atmosphere, water, and wildlife]] and the nearest [[stars]].

Furthermore the [[Hubble law]] predicts an [[empirical laws]] leveraging measurements of [[gravitational red shift]] the speed of recession of distant [[galaxies]] by their [[displacement]]. $$v=H_0r$$
with $$H_0=71{\text{km/s} \over \text{Mps}}$$
and the [[parsec]] is $3.26 \text{ ly}$, 

we can extrapolate and estimate the age of the universe.
