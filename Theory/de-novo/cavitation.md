#C18-E 

An effect that results in [[material phase subspeciation, allotropy, polymorphism, and hysteresis]], and also can cause [[disaster|damage]]. 

Is this a [[quantum]] [[Huygen's principle]]? #WaitWhat 

Also, presumably an example of a [[task]] that is possible.

Also natural in a discussion of 
- [[pressure]], 
- [[boiling]], 
- [[vaporizing]], 
- [[breaking stress]], 
- [[capacitive breakdown]],
- [[displacement current]]
- [[repulsion]]
