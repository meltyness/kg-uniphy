#C17-1 

A [[physical quantities]] describes a [[material]] capability for [[energy conversion]] of [[thermal energy]] through [[heat]].

Exchange by [[collision]] per [[test volume]] of [[material]]. When taken to the extreme of low values we arrive at a very important application, [[coolers, and refrigerators]]

Each [[atom]] or [[molecule]] interacting through [[van der Waals interaction]] and [[elastic collision]] exchange [[kinetic energy]] in a [[material system]].

- [[metals are generally better conductors]]
- [[air is generally a good insulator]]

#### ... [[formula]]
Due to the [[the zeroth law of thermodynamics]], this only occurs between [[test volume]] with differing [[temperature]], [[heat flows so that thermal energy goes only from hot to cold]], the [[heat current]] in thermal conduction, in terms of the [[temperature gradient]] is $$H = {dQ \over dt} = kA{T_H - T_C \over L}$$
#### ...in the case of varying [[temperature]],
We have [[Fourier's law of thermal conduction]] 
$$ H = {dQ \over dt} = -kA{dT \over dx}$$

Another inverse definition describing non-conduction exists, the [[R-value]] $$R = {L \over k}$$
