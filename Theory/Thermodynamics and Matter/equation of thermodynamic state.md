#C18-1 

When, in a [[physical systems]], the [[thermodynamic state]] [[state variable|variables]] have a relationship that is simple enough, an equation of state can be written down. 

[[archaic|Colloquially]], even if no simple relationship exists -- the associated tables are called "equations of state".

#### ... for a simple [[solid]]
#WaitWhat Following from [[law of conservation of energy]] and [[mass-energy equivalence]]
- $\beta$ [[coefficient of thermal expansion]]
- [[bulk stress|compressibility]] $k=1/B$
- Initial [[states]] $(V_0,p_0,T_0)$
- A state equation can be developed:
$$V=V_0[1+\beta(T-T_0) -k(p-p_0)]$$

#### ... for the [[ideal gas law]]
With [[molar mass]] $m=nM$, $pV=nRT$. 
This assumes 
- All [[intermolecular and interatomic forces]] [[collision]] are [[elastic collision]], 
- [[molecule]] have no [[volume]].

#### ... for the [[van der Waals equation]]
This accounts for two of the approximations of the [[ideal gas law]]

#### ... for an [[adiabatic]] [[thermodynamic process, path]]
An adiabatic process gives tthe following relationships:
$$T_1V_1^{\gamma - 1}=T_2V_2^{\gamma-1}$$
$$p_1V_1^\gamma = p_2V_2^{\gamma}$$
which of course apply to [[ideal gas internal energy theorem]].

#### ... general [[representation]]
-  [[pV-diagram]], may have 
	- [[isotherm]] a curve showing behavior of a [[specimen]] as an [[empirical laws]].
	- regions where [[material phase equilibrium]] exists or [[material phase change]]
- [[material phase diagram]]
