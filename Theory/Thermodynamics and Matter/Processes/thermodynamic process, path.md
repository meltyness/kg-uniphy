 #C19-3

A [[representation]] for the intermediate [[thermodynamic state]] encountered, the series of states is called a [[path]]. It refers to the path along the [[pVT-Surface]].

In this way thermodynamic paths are NOT necessarily [[conservation|conservative]].

#Caution Each of these relationships cannot be presumed strictly possible and imply approximation, this is where the thermodynamic process concept [[range of validity|breaks down]].

#WaitWhat is there a similar analysis for [[van der Waals equation]] and say a constant [[concentration]] process?

#### ... [[reversibility]], [[direction]], [[order and disorder]]
Natural processes are irreversible.

#### ... cyclicality
Any cyclic process is subjected to [[the first law of thermodynamics]].
