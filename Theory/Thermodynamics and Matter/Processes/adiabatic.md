#C19-8 

Details about an adiabatic process can be derived in the following way, holding  constant.

Given the process definition has relationship, $$\Delta U = -W$$

#### Derivation of [[equation of thermodynamic state]]
And the [[ideal gas law]], #Caution [[range of validity]] is only when the process occurs 
- Quickly enough to keep $Q=0$
- Remains in [[thermal equilibrium]], [[equilibrium]]

and [[heat capacity and specific heat]], [[ratio of heat capacities]] $C_P=C_V+R$,  $pV=nRT$, $\gamma = C_P/C_V$, and looking for the change in temperature we find the following

$$(\gamma - 1)C_V=R$$
With $dU = -dW$, and definition of work, $dW=p \ dV$ [[ideal gas internal energy theorem]], $dU=nC_V \ dT$ we can write $$nC_V \ dT = p \ dV$$
With the ideal gas law, $$nC_V \ dT = {nRT \over V} \ dV$$ Rearranging $${dT \over T}-{dV(\gamma - 1) \over V}=0$$
Integrating gives $$\int\bigg[{dT \over T}-{dV(\gamma - 1) \over V}=0\bigg] = 0 $$
and $$\ln{T}-\ln{V^{\gamma - 1}}=C $$
A new [[derivation]] technique that [[the appearance of a constant implies state]] gives the following [[equation of thermodynamic state]].
$$T_1V_1^{\gamma - 1}=T_2V_2^{\gamma-1}$$
and trivially, $$p_1V_1^\gamma = p_2V_2^{\gamma}$$
