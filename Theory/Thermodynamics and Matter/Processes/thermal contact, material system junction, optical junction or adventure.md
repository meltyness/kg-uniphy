#C17-1 

A [[thermodynamic state]] where two [[material]] [[test volume]] are capable of [[energy conversion|exchanging]] [[thermal energy]] -- as well as via [[geometric optics|optical interactions]]. 

This gives rise to the obvious concern regarding *how*, thermodynamically, 
- This status results in [[energy transformation and heat flow]].

And in [[optics]] we consider
- [[optical surface properties of materials]] as well as the
- [[optical lens]]
- [[optical mirror]]
