We also have the result that due to 
- [[gas as point particles]]
- [[the internal energy of an ideal gas depends only on its temperature, not on its pressure or volume]]
- [[the translational kinetic energy per molecule in an ideal gas depends only on temperature]]
- [[experiment or measurement]] involving [[breakable partition]]

which can be stated in terms of [[heat capacity and specific heat]] as, which is key in finding [[heat capacity and specific heat#for an ideal gas isobaric constant volume C_p|constant pressure heat capacity]]$$dU = nC_V \ dT$$ #Caution #Caution #Caution
