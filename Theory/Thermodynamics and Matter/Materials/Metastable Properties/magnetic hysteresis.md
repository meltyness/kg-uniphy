#C28-8 

Hysteresis is a type of [[material phase subspeciation, allotropy, polymorphism, and hysteresis|intrinsic material property]].

#### ... basic description
When a [[permanent magnet, ferromagnetic material|ferromagnetic]] [[material system]] is [[submersion|submerged]] in a [[magnetic field]] it approaches a [[magnetization density]] saturation point $M_\text{sat}$. When the field is removed, it will come to rest at some value of $M$ somewhat less than that. If the [[polarity]] is reversed it will go to $-M_\text{sat}$ and then relax to some $-M > -M_\text{sat}$.
