#C11-4 

Some examples include [[glass]], [[ceramic]].

#### ... and [[order and disorder]]
As confirmed by [[x-ray crystallography]], solids suffer from [[intermolecular long-range order]], in [[crystal]], [[crystal growth]].

In a [[glass]] is observed [[intermolecular short-range order]] a bit like a [[fluid]].

This can be manipulated by a [[voltage, or electric potential]] as in [[liquid crystals]] to control the [[polarization of optical rays]] for a [[display technology]]

#### ... and [[chemical and molecular bonding]]
Ionic bonds form stable crystals, with [[intermolecular and interatomic forces]] producing [[electron energy level]] lower than the separate [[atom]] and [[electronic configuration, and ionization]].

Covalent bonds form in [[diamond]], [[germanium]], [[silicon]], as well as in [[metallic bonding]] which leads to the [[lattice electronic energy]].

[[van der Waals interaction]] bonds occur in [[solid]] [[water]].
