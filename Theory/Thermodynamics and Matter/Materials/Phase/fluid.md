Fluids are a [[material]] implicit in the following interactions, does not have [[definite size and a definite shape]], further description starts in [[fluid mechanics]]. Define as any [[material]] capable of exhibiting [[fluid flow]]. An integral part of [[earth, atmosphere, water, and wildlife]].

Another important note is that a [[fluid]] is a [[material phase]] that has a [[surface area|surface]] which [[concavity|conforms]] to its [[container]]

For the purposes of introductory mechanics fluids are [[tensile-compressive stress|incompressible]].

#### ...[[mass density]] of fluids
[[mass density]] relates [[mass]] with [[volume]], the average [[mass density]] of a flulid is therefore,
$$\rho = {m \over V}$$

This also leads to a measure of [[mass density]], called [[specific gravity]].

#### ... fluids [[at rest]]
- [[bulk stress]]
- [[fluid resistance]], [[viscosity]]

#### ... fluid [[fluid flow]]
Two considerations are [[Bernoulli's equation]] and the [[continuity equation]].

#### ... fluids also [[ripples]] a form of [[mechanical waves]]
In this way, fluids exhibit motion.
