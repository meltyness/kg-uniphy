- A type of [[task]]
- This also implies [[material phase hysteresis]] where a phase can remain once the material has undergone a certain [[material phase change]].
- As well as [[magnetic hysteresis]]
- Another example where this appears is in [[deformation and elasticity]],
	- [[plastic deformation]] 
- When [[boiling]] and under other certain conditions [[cavitation]] is observed, [[supercavitation]]![[Allotropy and Plutonium.pdf]]
