#C18-6 

[[vaporizing|The vaporization curve]] has a cutoff called the [[critical point]] which marks the [[fluid-gas equilibrium region]] where no [[latent heat]] is needed for [[test volume]] of the [[material system]] to undergo [[material phase change]]

Where [[vaporizing]] and [[condensing]] can happen without [[latent heat]].
