#C14-1 

A [[material system]] in a [[material phase]] undergo [[material phase change]] under conditions that may be [[describe outcomes|described]] by a [[tropographic]] map of a [[pT-diagram]] or a [[pVT-Surface]]

Depending on
- [[kind of material]]
- [[thermodynamic state]]
- [[dynamics of materials]]

with the patterns described in a material phase chart from which one can derive

#### ...[[triple point]]
This appears on the chart.

[[at any pressure less than the triple point pressure, no liquid phase is possible]]

#### ...[[phase stability]]
Regions of the chart correspond to [[bistable phase equilibrium]]

#### ...[[condensing|Fusion curve]] / [[vaporizing|Vaporization curve]] / [[sublimating|Sublimation curve]]
This alludes to the [[latent heat]] boundaries before which [[material phase change]] occurs, an example of [[form an isostable measurement]]. 

Additionally exists [[fluid-gas equilibrium region]].

Even within a [[material phase]] there exists [[material phase subspeciation, allotropy, polymorphism, and hysteresis]]

#WaitWhat about [[solid-liquid equilibrium]]? ... see [[form an isostable measurement]] and the analysis of the [[coolers, and refrigerators]].
