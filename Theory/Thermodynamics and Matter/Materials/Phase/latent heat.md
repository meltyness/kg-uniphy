On the [[material phase diagram]] each [[kind of material]] will go through different [[material phase change]] given the correct [[thermodynamic state]]. 

In addition to this effect, there is an associated "latent heat" which implies that in undergoing that [[material phase change]] a certain amount of [[heat]] in or out of the [[material system]], and for each material that is quantified by 

#### Latent heat of fusion
[[solidfying]] takes [[energy]] per unit [[mass]] $$L_f \propto \{{J \over kg}\}$$

#### Latent heat of vaporization
[[vaporizing]] takes [[energy]] per unit [[mass]] $$L_v \propto \{{ J \over kg}\}$$
#### Latent heat of [[combustion]]
[[combustion]] releases [[energy]] per unit [[mass]]
$$L_c \propto \{ {J \over kg}\}$$
and there's an [[analogy|analogous]] process called [[digestion]]
