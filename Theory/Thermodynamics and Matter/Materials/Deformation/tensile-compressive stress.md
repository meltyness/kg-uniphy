#C11-4 

#### Introduction
This describes the [[deformation and elasticity|stretching]] or a bar or wire when its ends are pulled under [[tension force]], the action is on the [[length]] of the [[rigid body]] or [[solid]].

For $F_\perp$ [[action-reaction pair|equal and opposite]] at either end, the object is under tension, we have the [[formula]] relationship:
$$\text{Tensile stress} = {F_\perp \over A}$$
This form of [[stress]] is a [[scalar quantity]], and the [[SI units]] are the [[pascal]]

$$\text{Tensile strain} = {\Delta l \over l_0}$$
and so this is where we come to [[Young's modulus]], applying [[Hooke's law#General Form|the general form of Hooke's law,]]

$$Y = {\text{Tensile stress} \over \text{Tensile strain}}={F_\perp/A \over\Delta l/l_0}$$
[[compression|Compression]] is the special case where $\Delta l < 0$, the opposite case is called [[rarefaction]]

#### Specific Applications
Young's modulus is a good approximation, except for composite [[material]].
