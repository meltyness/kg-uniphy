#C11-4 

#### Introduction
This describes the type of stress encountered by a scuba diver under [[pressure]] and a [[hydraulic press]] uses these principles to generate force where the action is on the volume of the [[rigid body]]. 

The [[fluid]] in which the [[solid]] is [[submersion|submerged]] exerts a [[force]] with magnitude $F_\perp$, everywhere on the body's [[surface area]], $A$ we have the [[formula]] relationship $$p={F_\perp \over A}$$
And the [[bulk modulus]], $B$ measured against this change in volume, $\Delta V / V_0$ is such that an increase in pressure decreases volume, $$B = {\text{Bulk stress} \over \text{Bulk strain}} = {-\Delta p \over {\Delta V}/V_0}$$
The reciprocal of [[bulk modulus]] $1/B$ is called the [[compression|compressibility]]. $$k = {1 \over B} = -{\Delta V / V_0 \over \Delta p} \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \text{(compressibility)}$$
#### Specific Applications
A [[gas]] has a somewhat different character, such that $p_0$ is involved in the above -- that is the bulk modulus has a narrower [[range of validity]] for gasses.

This has applications to [[hydraulics]], [[pneumatics]].
