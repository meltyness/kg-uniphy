#C11-4 

#### Introduction
This describes a situation where forces act [[tangent]] to the [[surface area]] of a [[solid]] (and solid, only).

An example is [[cutting]].

$$\text{Shear stress} = {F_{\parallel} \over A}$$
And where $h$ is the width of the material (say as thin as a ribbon, or [[paper]]) then $x$ is the amount of [[displacement]] by the shear action. Generally $x << h$. $$\text{Shear strain} = {x \over h}$$
And in totality, the [[formula]] is $$S={\text{Shear stress} \over \text{Shear strain}} = {F_\parallel / A \over x/h}$$
