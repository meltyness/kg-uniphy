#C11-E 

When you put [[rope]] [[material]] under [[tension force]], and it behaves with [[tensile-compressive stress]] there is a relationship, in the [[formula]] where $w$ is the width of the object, $${\Delta w \over w_0} = -\sigma{\Delta l \over l_0}$$
$\sigma$ is a dimensionless quantity. 

#WaitWhat doesn't this imply feedback with [[Hooke's law#General Form|general form of Hooke's Law]] so as to suggest a [[derivation]] of computing the [[breaking stress]] of materials?

#WaitWhat can't you compute the poisson's ratio for a given geometric situation from the [[Young's modulus]]?
