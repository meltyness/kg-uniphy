#C18-3

Simply, a [[gas]] that follows the [[ideal gas law]] 

#### ... [[ideal gas internal energy theorem]]
- [[the internal energy of an ideal gas depends only on its temperature, not on its pressure or volume]]

which can be stated in terms of [[heat capacity and specific heat]] as, which is key in finding [[heat capacity and specific heat#for an ideal gas isobaric constant volume C_p|constant pressure heat capacity]]$$dU = nC_V \ dT$$
