Most 
- [[solid]] [[specimen]] 
- with [[monatomic]] [[elementary entities]] 
 
have a [[heat capacity and specific heat#molar mass Molar Heat Capacity|molar heat capacity]] $\approx 25 \text{ J/mol K} = 3R$ with the [[gas constant]]. This is approached from below as [[temperature]] increases from [[absolute zero]] (see #C18-4)

#WaitWhat leads to the [[hypotheses]] that heat capacity is primarily dependent on the number of [[atom|atoms]] in [[thermal contact, material system junction, optical junction or adventure|a thermal contact]]
