#C18-1 

A [[gas]] in a [[container]] has the following [[empirical laws]]

[[state variable|The following variables:]]
- [[pressure]]
- [[volume]]
- $n$ [[amount of a material]]
- [[temperature]]

And the [[gas constant]], $R$ 

As well as two proportionality constants:

- $a \ {\text{ J m}^3 \over \text{mol}^2}$ as a proxy for [[intermolecular and interatomic forces]] [[pressure]]
- $b \ { \text{m}^3 \over \text{mol} }$ as a proxy for [[volume]] occupied by the [[material system]]

Yields a [[formula]]:
$$(p+a{n^2\over V^2})(V-nb)=nRT$$
