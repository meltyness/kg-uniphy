#C18-4
Because [[molecules are always in motion]], [[thermal energy and kinetic energy are fungible]], we can take a [[statistical mechanics]] approach.

#### ... [[derivation]] of [[formula]] for each [[molecule]]
- Hold the [[material system]] [[isochorically]] and seek $C_V$
	- Otherwise the system would perform [[work]] on the [[container]]
-  Building on [[gas as point particles]] with $$dK_\text{tr}=\frac{3}{2}nR \ dT$$
- From [[heat capacity and specific heat#molar mass Molar Heat Capacity|molar heat capacity]] $Q = nC_V\Delta T$ implies $$dQ = nC_V \ dT$$
- So having set the system in motion, $dK_\text{tr} = dQ$ $$C_V = \frac{3}{2}R$$
- Which has a [[range of validity]] limited to the case of a [[monatomic]] system.

#### ... in a [[material system]] of [[diatomic]] and [[polyatomic]] [[molecule]]
We must consider [[intramolecular motion]] due to [[intramolecular forces]].

#### ... in a [[solid]] [[material system]] with [[monatomic]] [[molecule]]
- For a [[monatomic]] [[crystal]] with $N$ [[atom]]
- [[intermolecular and interatomic forces]] bind each [[atom]] to a [[equilibrium]] $r_0 \approx 0.3\text{ nm}$ 
- [[deformation and elasticity]] implies that these [[intermolecular and interatomic forces]] permit [[molecular motion]].
- We assume 3 [[degrees of freedom]] for each [[scalar quantity|component]] of [[velocity]]
- Applying the [[principle of equipartition of energy]] implies $E[K] = 3(\frac{1}{2}kT)$
- Applying [[spring potential energy]] implies $E[U] = 3(\frac{1}{2}kT)$
	- (see also [[simple harmonic motion#atom vibrations in material|atomic vibrations as simple harmonic motion]])
- Which gives $\bar{E} = 3kT$
- And the [[Rule of Dulong and Petit]] follows, $$C_V=3R$$
