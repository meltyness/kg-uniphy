#C17-5 
Heat capacity is a property of a [[kind of material]]. It is the amount of [[work]] needed to change the [[temperature]] of the substance. 

#### ...[[heat capacity experimental setup]]
It [[what can be measured|can be]] [[experiment or measurement|measured]] [[isobarically]] for a [[fluid]], or [[isochorically]] for a [[gas]].  For a [[solid]], at constant pressure, we'll measure $c_p \text{ or } C_p$  or [[isochorically]] (constant [[volume]]) for a [[gas]], $c_v  \text{ or } C_v$. 

#### ...[[heat capacity as a result of molecules]]
Because [[molecules are always in motion]], [[thermal energy and kinetic energy are fungible]], we can take a [[statistical mechanics]] approach.

#### ... [[ratio of heat capacities]]
This follows from the definitions, and has applications elsewhere.

#### ... for an [[ideal gas]] [[isobaric|constant volume]] $C_p$
- We allow the [[volume]] to vary, and introduce a source of [[heat]], controlling it to have constant [[pressure]] follow $$ dQ=nC_p\ dT \ \ \ \ \ \text{and} \ \ \ \ \  dW=p\ dV \implies$$
- and then with [[the first law of thermodynamics]], $$ nC_pdT = dU + nRdT$$
- and finally, *[[the internal energy of an ideal gas depends only on its temperature, not on its pressure or volume|the total energy changes only with temperature]]* since this is an ideal gas
$$nC_pdT = nC_VdT + nRdT \implies$$$$ \therefore C_p=C_V+R$$
#### ... specific heat / [[thermal energy]] concentration
Specific heat is a [[physical quantities]] which is a property of a [[thermodynamic state]] and [[formula|with]] $$c_V = {1 \over m}{dQ \over dT}$$

#### ... [[molar mass|using moles]] for heat capacity
For moles $n$, molar mass $M$, we can write the $$Q = nMC_V\Delta T$$
So $C_V=Mc_V$ and we can write $$ C_V={1 \over n}{dQ \over dT} $$
