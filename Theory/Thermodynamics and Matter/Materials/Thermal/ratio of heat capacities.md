#C16-2 

Expressed in terms of [[heat capacity and specific heat]] for an [[ideal gas]], this [[physical quantities]], represented by $\gamma$ this is a [[scalar quantity]] describing the [[formula|relationship]] between the [[bulk modulus]] and the [[pressure]] of a [[gas]].
$$B = \gamma p_0$$
we also have the definition in terms of [[heat capacity and specific heat]], $$\gamma = {C_p \over C_v}$$
For intutive reasons this has applications to:
- [[dynamics of a sound wave]]
- [[fluid flow]]
- as a [[Hooke's law]] approach to the [[restoring force]], more generally.
