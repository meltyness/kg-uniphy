#C17-4

A [[bimetallic strip]], [[thermometer]], and [[bridge]] all must account for this [[motion]] of [[material]].

We [[abstract negligible facets]] of how this impacts [[wood]] or [[intermolecular long-range order]], which may expand differently in different directions.

We can understand this in terms of [[van der Waals interaction]] as a [[spring force]], where each [[atom]] is in [[simple harmonic motion]] about [[equilibrium]], with more [[thermal energy]], the average [[displacement]] grows.

This has important applications in [[planes and flight]]

#### ... in [[length|Linear]] Expansion
This is given by the [[formula]] $$\Delta L = \alpha L_0 \Delta T$$
$\alpha$ is called [[coefficient of thermal expansion]]. #Caution  this also implies [[conservation of shape]] and is a [[approximating specific complications|linear approximation to a more complicated situation]].

#### ... in [[Volume]] Expansion
For an increase in temperature, we expect both [[solid]] and [[fluid]] expansion.

This is given by the [[formula]], $$\Delta V_0 = \beta V_0 \Delta T$$where $\beta$ is the coefficient of volume expansion, and again -- is only a linear approximation.

#### ... of [[water]]
The careful evaluation of this substance is key to [[earth, atmosphere, water, and wildlife]].

- Between $\text{273.15 K - 277.15 K}$ water has a cusp in its behavior.
- This interacts with [[buoyancy]] to create a [[fluid flow]] of warmer water downward and results in water [[solidfying]] from the surface downward.

#### ... resulting in [[tensile-compressive stress]]
The following [[derivation]] describes this:

A rod with $L_0, A$ is held at a length while we have $\Delta T$ temperature reduction (the rod wants to shrink) $$({\Delta L \over L_0})_\text{thermal}=\alpha \Delta T$$
and with $$Y={F/A \over \Delta L / L_0}$$
we can solve for $${F \over A} = -Y\alpha \Delta T$$
