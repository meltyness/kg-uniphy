#C11-4 

#### Discussion
In building [[simple machines]] and [[manmade structures]], materials are used.

At some scales at which our [[models]] are applicable, a good abstraction is the material, which have at certain scales these properties:

> All familiar matter is made up of [[molecule|molecules]]

[[all familiar matter is made up of molecules]]

#### macroscopic properties include
- [[material system]] (is it there?)
- [[kind of material]] (what is it?)
- [[mass density]] (how much?)
- [[thermodynamic state]] (how does it behave as a gas?)
	- [[free expansion]]
- [[surface tension]] (how does it behave as a fluid?)
- [[heat capacity and specific heat]] (what if you set it into [[fluid flow]]?)
- [[material phase]] (does it every change spontaneously?)
- [[thermal expansion]] Introduced #C15-E 15.67 
	- #WaitWhat - where is the microscopic picture?
- [[deformation and elasticity]] (what is its internal behavior like?)
	- #WaitWhat - where is the microscopic picture?
- Producing [[molecular occlusion slits]], [[friction force]], [[fluid resistance]], [[emissivity]] (what if you take two such systems?) as well as [[optical surface properties of materials]]

#### microscopic properties include
- [[chemical formula]] (and force them to mix?)
- [[molecule]] (or distill the constituents?)
- [[electrical properties of materials]] (or introduce other [[elementary entities]] and [[thermal energy]])
- [[magnetic properties of materials]]
- [[chemical potential energy]] (or burn them?)
- [[molecular motion]] (or simply [[observe]] them?)
	- [[molecular diffusion]]
- [[order and disorder]] (over long time scales?)
- [[logical]] distinction of having [[rest mass]] in [[Einstein's special theory of relativity]].
- [[wavefunction]] (at a more [[subatomic particle|granular]] level)
- [[subatomic particle]] (how do their dimensions, especially [[subatomic particle lifetime]] compare to typical matter?)

#### applications include
- [[metallic bonding]]
- [[glass]]
- [[semiconductors]] for [[electronic devices]]
