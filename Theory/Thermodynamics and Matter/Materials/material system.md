#C17-2

In the scope of [[thermodynamics]], [[electromagnetic interaction]], [[optics]] this abstraction can be used to [[abstract negligible facets|ignores]]
- [[contamination]]
- [[chemical formula]]
- [[molecular geometry]]

Under [[experiment or measurement]] may be called a [[specimen]].

When considered in [[thermal contact, material system junction, optical junction or adventure|thermal contact]], these are subject to (and primarily defined by) [[the zeroth law of thermodynamics]].

In the scope of [[material]], this includes
- [[subatomic particle]]
- [[molecular motion]]
- [[electromagnetic waves and light]]
- [[phonon]]
