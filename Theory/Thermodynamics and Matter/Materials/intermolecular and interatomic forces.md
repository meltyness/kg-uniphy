Forces that are not due to [[chemical formula]]. 

### ...[[The Lennard-Jones Potential]]
A [[potential energy]] for two [[molecule]]

#### #ThumbRule ... for a collection of [[exotic molecular structures|non-exotic]] [[molecule|molecules]]
For a given [[thermodynamic state]] you'll have molecules behaving with the following properties
- We [[abstract negligible facets]] for the strength of the [[gravitational interaction]].
- A [[molecule]] has [[electric charge]] distribution with its [[chemical formula]], [[molecular geometry]] [[Coulomb's law]] force is experienced.
- There exists a [[equilibrium]] spacing, $r_0$ where any closer the IMF result in [[repulsion]], otherwise they become an [[attraction]].
- The spacing in [[solid]] or [[fluid]] corresponds roughly to the [[equilibrium]] spacing, $r_0$ where any closer the IMF result in [[repulsion]], otherwise they become an [[attraction]].
- $F_r(r)$ corresponds to the force, and given this is a [[conservative force, field]], $$F_r(r)={-dU \over dr}$$
- The "u-shape" correcting to an equilibrium point is called a [[potential well]]. $|U_0|$, corresponding to the minimum is the amount of [[energy]] needed to kick a molecule out.
- Because each [[molecule]] has a [[chemical formula]] and [[molecular geometry]]
- The amount of motion of each molecule varies with [[kinetic energy]],
- Usually increases with [[temperature]].
- At high temps, $E[K] > |U_0|$ corresponding to the [[gas]] [[material phase]]
- At very low extreme temps, $E[K] << |U_0|$ corresponding to [[condensing]].

#### For [[solid]]
- In a solid, the [[molecular motion]] can be approximated as [[simple harmonic motion]] about a [[intermolecular long-range order]] using [[approximating specific complications]] due to [[van der Waals interaction]]

#### For a [[fluid]]
- The liquid exhibits [[intermolecular short-range order]] which should give rise to effects like [[surface tension]]
