#C18-3 

If each [[molecule]] is modeled as a spherical [[test volume]] with [[molecular radius]] $r$ -

- [[how often|how often do they collide with other molecules]]
- [[how much on average|how far do they travel, on average, between collisions]]

#### Assumptions
- A [[material system]] with one [[kind of material]] and [[molecule]] as [[elementary entities]]
- $N$ [[molecule]] with [[molecular radius]] $r$
	- in a Cylindrical [[test volume]] with [[volume]] $V$

#### The [[models|model]]
- **Only 1 molecule is moving**
- When a [[molecular collision]] occurs, the distance between them is $2r$
- Suppose a cylindrical [[test volume]] with
	- [[molecular radius]] $2r$
	- length $vdt$ 
- A simple [[ratio]] gives $${dN \over dt} = {4\pi r^2vN \over V}$$
- #WaitWhat #WheresTheBeef 

- But for the population when **everything is in motion**$${dN \over dt} = \sqrt{2}{4\pi r^2vN \over V}$$
- Then the [[mean free time]] $$t_\text{mean} = {V \over {4\pi\sqrt{2}r^2vN}}$$
- And the [[mean free path]] $$\lambda = vt_\text{mean}={V \over 4 \pi\sqrt{2}r^2 N}$$
