#C19-1 

A [[abstract negligible facets|system]] consisting of some [[degrees of freedom|number]] of [[material system]] and points of [[thermal contact, material system junction, optical junction or adventure]]. We can draw a [[test volume]] around the system, and establish [[externality]]. Internally, systems do [[work]] on eachother by [[energy transformation and heat flow|exchanging heat]]. They can also be an [[isolated system]], and will then have $\Delta U = 0$

#Caution some confusing exposition
$Q$ describes the [[heat]] going into the system.
$W$ describes the [[work]] done by the system.

#### ... [[work]] done during [[volume]] changes
#C19-2
Since a [[material system]] is always exerting a [[pressure]], any changes in volume imply the following [[formula]]: $$ W = \int_{V_1}^{V_2}p\ dV$$
#### ... [[internal energy]]
Defined as the sum of all constitutent [[elementary entities]] [[kinetic energy]] and of their internally-sourced [[potential energy]] (this is **not** a [[operational definition of physical quantities|operational definition]], since [[its impossible to construct a machine to measure every particle in meaningfully large thermodynamic systems]]) #WaitWhat $$U = \sum (K_i + U_i)$$ Total energy can change during a [[thermodynamic process, path]] which gives [[the first law of thermodynamics]] $$\Delta U = U_2 - U_1=Q-W$$ $Q-W$ enables an [[operational definition of physical quantities|operational definition]], thinking trivially of the [[Joule-Thomson Effect]].

While a [[thermodynamic process, path]] may not conserve $W$, $\Delta U$  **is** path independent.
