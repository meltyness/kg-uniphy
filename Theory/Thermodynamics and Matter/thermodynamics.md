#C16-2 

Thermodynamics describes how [[temperature]] [[energy conversion]] occurs through [[heat]], through a [[test volume]] of [[material system]] as well as producing or absorbing [[work]].

[[rough timeline of thermodynamics]]

#### ...[[the laws of thermodynamics]]
There are [[physical laws and principles|laws]] that describe this interaction.

#### ...[[thermal equilibrium]]
Two [[material]] no longer are changing temperature.

#### ...[[energy transformation and heat flow]]
This broadly describes thermodynamics.

#### ...[[thermodynamic process, path]]
Provides a description for moving between [[thermodynamic state]] continuously.

#### ... [[the Carnot cycle]]
An exploration of the limitations of the principles.
