#C17-7 

When a [[material system]] with [[thermal energy]] is in [[fluid flow]] or [[motion]] its [[material]] can create a difference in [[temperature]].

Exchange by [[fluid flow]] per [[test volume]] of [[material]]

Due to the complications of [[fluid flow]], and the open-issues with the [[Navier-Stokes Equation]], there is no simple equation to describe convection of [[heat]].

There is [[stationary convection]] and [[forced convection]] to consider 

#### Key principles
For [[thermal contact, material system junction, optical junction or adventure|thermal contact]] between a [[fluid]] and a [[solid]] consider the following #ThumbRule
- The [[heat current]] due to convection is proportional to the [[surface area]], which leads to the design of [[air conditioning]]
- Since [[viscosity]] varies with [[temperature]], [[at rest]] an insulative film appears at the point of [[thermal contact, material system junction, optical junction or adventure|thermal contact]]
- If we [[simply fit a relationship]], the [[formula]] can be $$H \approx k(\Delta T)^{5/4}$$
