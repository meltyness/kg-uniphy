#C17-7 

Two [[material system]] exchange heat through [[electromagnetic waves and light]].

Exchange by [[electromagnetic waves and light]] per [[surface area]] of [[material]]

This is the principle [[incandescent light bulbs]] operate off of where [[thermal energy]] is spontaneously emitted as [[electromagnetic waves and light|light]] of a certain [[electromagnetic spectrum, frequency of light|color]]. 

All [[material]], even at moderate temperatures emits [[thermal energy]] at differing [[electromagnetic spectrum, frequency of light]] in this way.

This also raises the concept of an [[ideal blackbody]], and an [[ideal reflector]].

#### [[formula]] for [[heat current]]
Where $\sigma$ is the [[Stefan-Boltzmann constant]], and $e$ is the [[emissivity]]. #WaitWhat is this the [[Blackbody Radiation Disaster]]? $$H = {dQ \over dt} = Ae\sigma T^4$$
but that only applies in a [[vacuum]], 

#### [[formula]] for the [[superposition of heat transfer]]
Where the net radiation is the difference of powers.
$$H_\text{net}=Ae\sigma(T^4-T_s^4)$$
