[[optics|Light]], [[heat radiation and absorption, thermal radiation]], [[radio]], and other [[electromagnetic spectrum, frequency of light]] which arise from the [[electromagnetic interaction]].  A complete [[explanation]] follows from [[Maxwell's laws]] of the [[electromagnetic interaction]] as a [[wave]]. These waves carry [[energy]] and [[momentum]].
In [[sinusoidal waves|sinusoidal electromagnetic waves]], $\vec{E}, \vec{B}$ are a [[function]] of [[time]], [[position]] #WaitWhat (how does this relate to [[relative velocity]]?) Further description of the mechanics follows in the study of [[optics]].

#### ... basic facts of light
- [[the motion of light, and light propagation]] occurs from accelerated charges.
- The [[wave medium]] (such as a [[material system]]) modifies the [[permittivity]] and [[permeability]] (which may be [[models|modeled as]] a [[function]] of [[position]] in [[space]])
- An [[L-C circuits]] can be used to place [[electric charge]] into [[simple harmonic motion]].
- The work of [[Guglielmo Marconi]] lead to the proliferation of [[radio]] -- the field oscillations of light exert [[force]] onto [[electric charge freedom|free charges]] on a [[electrical conductivity, and resistivity|conductor]].
	- #ConstructorTheory light is the fastest known [[phenomena of nature]] capable of the [[communications]] in space [[task]].
- [[electromagnetic spectrum, frequency of light]] determines macroscopic properties
- [[electromagnetic wave polarization]] is determined by the orientation of $\vec{E}$.

#### ... as a plane wave / [[step]] wave
- With a flat [[wavefront]] moving at a speed, we'll call the [[speed of light]], $c$, 
- $\vec{E} \perp \vec{B}$ at all points before, fields unidirectional
- $\vec{E}=\vec{0}, \vec{B}=\vec{0}$ just beyond,

such a plane wave can be analyzed with Faraday, Ampere's law under square windows of integration to arrive at: $$E=cB \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ B=\epsilon_0\mu_0cE \implies $$ $$c = {1 \over \sqrt{\epsilon_0\mu_0}}$$
#### ... general form and [[wave equation]]
- With a flat wavefront, again a plane wave, but instead of everywhere-equal fields, continuously varying magnitudes, $E, B$, but unidirectional such that only one [[scalar quantity|component]] of the [[vector quantity]] of the [[vector field]] at that position. Linearly polarized so that $E_y$ is the only non-zero component of the electric field.
- Consider $\Delta x$ between two points inside the wave
- Write only the difference between the field at those points computing [[Faraday's law of induction]], [[Ampere's law]]

Disregarding the precise derivation, except to say that it follows from the above geometric assumptions that lights up with the [[wave equation]]: $${\partial^2 E_y(x,y) \over \partial x^2} = \epsilon_0\mu_0{\partial^2 E_y(x,y) \over \partial t^2}$$
#### ... [[sinusoidal waves]], and [[transverse wave]] interpretation
The plane-wave assumption above has a [[range of validity]] especially applicable when far away from the source.

A single [[optical ray]] of the wave has [[wave number]], [[angular frequency]], and [[amplitude]] $$\vec{E}(x,t)=\hat{j}E_\text{max}\cos(kx-\omega t) \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \vec{B}(x,t)=\hat{k}B_\text{max}\cos(kx-\omega t)$$ typical rules regarding wave behavior apply, except that $v$ is $c$ in vacuum, or otherwise related to $\mu, \epsilon$ and so $$c=\lambda f$$
#### ... in a [[material system]]
The [[wave medium]] of light has [[permittivity]] and [[permeability]], can also be written in terms of [[dielectric constant]], [[relative permeability]] that modify its [[wave speed]] with $$v={1 \over \sqrt{\epsilon\mu}}={1 \over \sqrt{KK_\text{m}}}{1 \over \sqrt{\epsilon_0\mu_0}}={c \over \sqrt{KK_\text{m}}}$$
we also establish the [[index of refraction]] $${c \over v} = n =\sqrt{KK_\text{m}}\approx\sqrt{K}$$
we also adjust the discussion of [[dielectric, and dielectric strength]] to claim that $K$ changes across the [[electromagnetic spectrum, frequency of light|spectrum]].

#### ... and [[electric field]], [[magnetic field]] [[energy density]]
Similar to the arguments:
- [[self inductance, and inductors#human control and energy|energy density in self-inductance]] - following from [[electrical power dissipation]], [[Biot-Savart law]], and [[magnetic flux]]
- [[ideal capacitor#as a method of energy storage and transmission|energy density in a capacitor]] - how much [[work]] to create the [[material system charge polarization]] per unit [[volume]]

Following from $E=cB$, $u=\frac{1}{2}\epsilon_0E^2 + {B^2 \over 2\mu}$, $$u = \epsilon_0E^2$$as a [[flux]] gives the [[Poynting vector]]

#WaitWhat / #ConstructorTheory [[task]] light is a [[tropographic]] wave.

#### ... in terms of [[momentum]], and [[pressure]]
Waves carry [[momentum]], and this can be considered in terms of [[momentum density]] this momentum produces [[radiation pressure]]
