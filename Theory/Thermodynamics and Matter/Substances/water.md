#C17-5 

Water has a number of properties

- [[heat capacity and specific heat]]
- [[molar mass]] of $\approx 18.0 \text{ g/mol}$

As a [[fluid]] at $4^\circ \text{ C}$
- [[mass density]] of $\approx 1.000 \text{ g/mL} = 1000 \text{ kg / m}^3$

Due to its [[electrical dipole]] it is a good [[chemical solvent]] for producing [[material mixture#Aqueous]]. It's dipole moment is approx $p = 6.17\times10^{-30} \text{ C m}$. One can model [[surface tension]] as being caused by [[electrical dipole]]
