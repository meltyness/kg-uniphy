#C17-3 

The triple point of [[water]] is at a [[temperature]] and [[pressure]] [[thermodynamic state]]$$0.01^\circ C \ \  \ \ \ \text{and}\ \ \ 610 \text{ Pa} \approx 0.006 \text{ atm} $$
It is where water can exist simultaneously as the [[gas]], [[fluid]], [[solid]] [[material phase]].

And so $$T_\text{triple} = 273.16 \text{ K}$$
