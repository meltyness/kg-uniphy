#KeyConcept 

### Definition
The property of having [[displacement]] that can be [[experiment or measurement|experimentally measured]] after passage of some [[time]].

[[kinematics|Equations of motion]] in the most general sense, this is what we seek, in order to [[making predictions with physics|make good predictions]].

### [[Representation]]
#### $x\text{-}t$ graphs of motion
For a specific [[particle]], a component of its [[position]] is represented against [[time]].

- The [[slope]] of such a graph represents the [[velocity]]
- The [[concavity]] of such a graph represents the [[acceleration]]

#### motion diagram
A motion diagram displays, as a collection of graphs at different $t_i$ the position $x_i$ and the velocity $v_i$ -- for example.

# ... of the small
#### ... [[at rest]]
...kind of the opposite, of motion, see [[equilibrium]] for a full discussion, this type of motion can also be throught of as [[balance]].

#### ... [[deformation and elasticity]]
The quintessential case considered was [[spring force]], deformation can be considered a type of motion.

#### ... [[periodic motion and oscillation]]
Behavior exhibited in [[electromagnetic waves and light]], [[sound]], [[material vibration]], [[AC circuits]], [[mechanical waves]]

#### ... [[fluid flow]], [[slosh]], [[water hammer]], 
Types of motion undergone by a [[fluid]].

#### ... [[heat]]
For the very small, this is the transaction of energy

#### ... [[molecular motion]]
For the smallest [[elementary entities]], motion is observed.

#### ... [[intermolecular motion of charges]], [[current density]]
For [[electric charge]] in a [[material system]]

#### ... [[motion involving electrical charges]]
Again, for [[electric charge]] [[material]]

#### ... [[scattering]], [[reflection]], [[transmission]]
A kind of [[intramolecular motion]] between disparate [[elementary entities]], and [[subatomic particle]].

#### ... [[quantum kinematics]]
[[elementary entities]] at scales where #WaitWhat 

# ... of the large
#### ... in a [[collision]]
Bodies interact together in what is described as a collision, a common situation involving, causing, incident to motion.

#### ... [[motion of rigid bodies]]
The basic forms of motion may be generalized to draw predictions about the motion of [[mechanical system|systems]] of particles.

#### ... [[satellite motion]]
A result of the [[gravitational interaction]]

#### ... [[mechanical waves]]
Closely related to the above, [[sound]], [[ripples]], and [[earth, atmosphere, water, and wildlife|earthquakes]]

#### ... [[temperature]]
This is the average kinetic energy of a substance

#### ... [[thermal expansion]]
When a [[rigid body]] can be modeled as having [[temperature]]-dependent [[length]], [[surface area]], [[volume]]

#### ... [[material phase change]]
Changes between [[fluid]], [[solid]], [[gas]]

#### ... [[optics]]
Generally the [[path]] along which light travels is determined by the large scale system.

#### ... [[relativity]]
At very high speeds, the [[kinematics]] of [[material]] poses different concerns as well as the observed nature of the [[gravitational interaction]].
