#C33-1 
Depending on the system [[assume common, reasonable system geometry|geometry]] and [[optical surface properties of materials]], the outcome of the interaction between an [[optical ray]] and a [[material system]] presents the following concerns:

#### ... under [[reflection of electromagnetic waves|reflection]]
##### ... [[law of specular reflection]]
Latin for [[mirror]]

##### ... [[diffuse reflection]]
This is what causes the reflecting [[material system]] to be [[visible]].

##### ... [[law of total internal reflection]]
At extreme [[incident]] angles, the [[light intensity]] of the reflected light varies

#### ... #Warning under [[law of dielectric reflection, and phase shifting]]
Following from [[Maxwell's laws]], this form of specular reflection can change the [[phase]].

#### ... under [[transmitted|transmission]]
When a [[optical ray]] travels through a [[thermal contact, material system junction, optical junction or adventure|junction]] it is subject to

##### ... [[law of light transmission, and refraction]]
Determines the direction of the passed light

##### ... [[Rayleigh scattering]]
When a [[thermal contact, material system junction, optical junction or adventure|junction]] has [[electrical properties of materials]] (such as [[current density]]such that it transmits light via [[heat radiation and absorption, thermal radiation]]

##### ... [[electromagnetic wave polarization]]
This is another transmission-type [[phenomena of nature]].

##### ... [[speed of light]] and [[index of refraction]]
Due to [[Maxwell's laws]], light changes speed depending on the [[permeability]] and [[permittivity]] of the [[kind of material]] it is traveling through. It does so with the [[index of refraction]], 
1. Upon arrival at a material boundary following from [[reflection of electromagnetic waves]], the [[electromagnetic spectrum, frequency of light|frequency of the light]] does not change.
2. The [[speed of light]] inside of the material does, and following from $v=\lambda f$ we arrive at:
$$\lambda = {\lambda_0 \over n}$$

#### ... [[phenomenology]] of light propagation
- A [[wavefront]] describes [[wave]] [[kinematics]], for waves that are produced by phenomena described in [[electromagnetic waves and light]].
	- [[the wavefront of light is the locus of all adjacent points at which the phase of vibration of a physical quantity associated with the wave is the same]]
	- There are two common such locuses
		- spherical
		- plane wave
		- see [[electromagnetic waves and light#as a plane wave step wave|plane wave]]
- Folowing from [[Maxwell's laws]] both reflection and refraction can occur simultaenously, consider that [[glass]] is a [[dielectric, and dielectric strength|dielectric]], and under small, fast variations in [[electric charge]], an [[ideal capacitor]] is a [[high-pass filter]] which should support some charge motion and the production of a reflection.
	- [[law of dielectric reflection, and phase shifting]]
- An [[optical ray]] describes the [[field]] behavior, akin to [[electric field lines]]/[[magnetic field lines]].
	- [[a ray is an imaginary line along the direction of travel of the wave]]
	- It also can be endowed with [[wave speed]], in addition to its [[direction]].
	- The study is [[geometric optics]]
- Within a [[material system]] that is [[form an isotropic measurement|isotropic]], 
	- At a [[thermal contact, material system junction, optical junction or adventure]] 
		- The [[wave speed]], and [[direction]] may change, but are straight within the material.
		- #WaitWhat  is this an idealization? #GotIt curves occur in a gradient following from [[principle of image transitivity]].
- In a non-isotropic material,
	- Again, different directions may have different preferences so propagation is ellipsoidal, rather than spherical, to produce [[polarization of optical rays#circular elliptical polarization|circular or elliptical polarization]].

These two representations are everywhere perpendicular, again like [[equipotential surfaces]]. 

Considering the [[optical ray]], several key processes take place

#### ... [[phenomenology]] of interacting light motion
An [[optical ray]] is incident ,[[material surface normal]] of a [[material system]], with an angle $\theta_a$ off the [[material surface normal]].
1. The [[incident]], [[reflection]], [[transmitted]], and [[material surface normal]] are all [[the optical ray parameters at a junction are coplanar|coplanar]]
2. The reflection angle is equal to the attack angle
3. The ratio of sines is inversely proportional to the indexes of refraction.

These are useful to produce a [[derivation of the laws of ideal geometric optics]]
