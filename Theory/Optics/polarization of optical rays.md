#C33-5 

A [[build, or part]] of an [[optical computing]] that [[task|produce]] [[electromagnetic wave polarization]].

#### ... circular, elliptical polarization
[[helix]]-[[definite size and a definite shape]] polarization exists when the direction of $\vec{E}$ varies with respect to the [[optical ray]] direction of travel. [[right-hand rule]] applies to identify "right circular polarization." With respect to the direction of travel $E_x(t) = E_z(t-T/4)$, where $T$ is the [[oscillatory period]].

Additionally there can be [[elliptical]] polarization, in case:
- $E_{z\text{ max}} < E_{x\text{ max}}$
- $E_x(t) = E_z(t - P)$ where $P$ is some period, such that $P \ne T/4$ 

for example from two [[communications antenna|antennas]] phased and presented different [[current density]]. 

This can be implemented by running an [[optical ray]] through a material exhibiting [[birefringence]].

#### ... in [[law of specular reflection|reflection]] and [[law of total internal reflection|rejection]] by polarization, [[Brewster's law]]
#WaitWhat can this be produced by [[law of total internal reflection|total internal reflection]]?

#### ... in transmission by filters, [[Malus's law]]
A simple ratio describes [[light intensity]] for polarizing filters

#### ... [[polarizing filters]]
Upon [[law of light transmission, and refraction|transmission]] through certain [[kind of material]], polarization occurs.

#### ... [[phenomenology]] of ideal polarization
In ideal polarization on non-polarized light, 
- [[natural light, and continuous spectra|Non-polarized light]] exists.
- 100% of the light is in the selected mode
- 0% of the light is in any other filtered mode
- 50% of the [[light intensity]] escapes, since axes are assumed to be equal.
	- Because of [[superposition of fields]], any component is the sum of two perpendicular components, and following from the suppositions, half of the incident components are therefore passed unattenuated.
	- #WaitWhat let's get a [[derivation]] of this. #GotIt simply 
	- for an equal superposition of non-polarized components, $I_0/2\pi$
	- apply [[Malus's law]] for each angle, $\sin^2\phi$
	- compute the resulting $I$. $$I_A = {I_0 \over 2\pi}\int_0^{2\pi}\sin^2\phi \ d\phi={I_0 \over 2}$$
