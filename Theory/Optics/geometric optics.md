#C34-1 

This deals in-depth with the [[explanation]] that the [[optical ray]] describes [[the motion of light, and light propagation]]. 

The [[range of validity]] supposes that rays of light are
- not subject to interference #WaitWhat 
- in materials with constant [[index of refraction]]
- 

#### ... [[optical imaging]]
Following from [[the motion of light, and light propagation]], the concerns involved in finding the [[object-image relationship]].

#### ... [[optical magnification]]
One key objective of optical imaging is to produce this effect.

#### ... [[focal point, and focal length]]
Focal length $f$ broadly characterizes the [[image distance]] in terms of lens geometry.

#### ... [[aberration]]
When the relationship [[object-image relationship]] is not simple in the [[range of validity]].

#### ... [[sign rules of geometric optics]]
These characterize the [[image point]] produced. 

#Caution these need not always be clear from the model. That is the sign rule for $s'$ may need to be used to determine the location, rather than determining the location before modeling.

#### Applications
