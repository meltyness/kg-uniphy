#C38-4 

- [[Ernest Rutherford]] demonstrated with [[alpha particles]] in [[gold]] [[foil]] the [[scattering]] before passing to a [[screen]] or [[scintillator]]
	- Due to the presence and [[density]] of large-angle [[scattering]] determined the presence and [[length]] of the [[nucleus]].
	- A only the indicated [[charge density]] can produce the observed angle scattering.
