#C36-1 

- Fresnel diffraction when the [[the motion of light, and light propagation]] source is close to the [[screen]]. A bit like [[intermolecular short-range order]]
- Fraunhofer diffraction when [[electromagnetic waves and light#as a plane wave step wave|a plane wave]] can be in consideration, a bit like [[intermolecular long-range order]].
