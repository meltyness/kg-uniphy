#C33-4

For longer wave lengths, most [[material system]] have lower [[index of refraction]] which causes the [[angle]] of the [[optical ray]] to deviate further for higher-energy [[electromagnetic spectrum, frequency of light|frequencies of light]]. A sort of [[dispersion]]

An easy way to remember this #ThumbRule is in terms of [[diamond]] brilliance.
- Diamond is very [[mass density|dense]].
- As such it has a very high [[index of refraction]]
- It has greater propensity to create large dispersions across the spectrum
- Diamond is "brilliant."

#### ... [[earth, atmosphere, water, and wildlife|rainbows]]
- [[water]] as a [[gas]] in the [[atmosphere]] exhibits scattering.
- The sun emits white light that is a [[superposition of fields]] across the [[electromagnetic spectrum, frequency of light|spectrum]].
- part of the [[optical ray]] of [[visible light]] [[stars|sun]] from behind the [[light detection|observer]] is reflected
	- Varying with reflected angle per-droplet, for certain angles, critically dispersed light appears to have varying [[light intensity]] for given [[visible light|color]].
- Additionally two such reflections occur due to the separate geometries of reflection possible in a water droplet
	- to [[take cases]],
		- incident ray crosses reflected ray
		- incident ray does *not* cross reflected ray (the ray was [[law of total internal reflection|reflected]] twice off of the droplet before reaching the observer)
