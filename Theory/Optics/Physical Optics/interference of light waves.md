#### ... simplifying assumptions
- Two [[sinusoidal waves]] propagate,
	- The [[wavefront]] can be viewed as [[definite size and a definite shape|concentric]] from a [[point object]]
	- This is [[monochromatic]] since the [[electromagnetic spectrum, frequency of light]] in a sinusoidal wave is everywhere the same, #Caution another [[range of validity]] concern, since this isn't strictly possible thus implying that they are [[coherent waves]]
	- They also share the same [[phase]]
	- They have the same [[amplitude]] / [[electric field]] $E_\text{max}$ and [[polarization angle]]
	- They are positioned equidistant from the [[origin]]

#### ... in a [[thin film]]
This can be established as a property of [[optical surface properties of materials]].

#### ... [[double-slit experiment]]
This demonstrates unequivocally that light is a wave, and also provides a method for determining [[light intensity]].

#### [[mechanical wave antinode|antinodal]] and [[mechanical wave node|nodal]] [[path|curves]]
We can also construct, equivalent to [[equipotential surfaces]] nodal, and antinodal curves for each [[wavelength]] passage, $m$.

#### ... constructive interference
A [[wavefront]] arrives at $a$, the same distance from the two sources, therefore at $(\vec{a}, t)$ has amplitude $$A= \hat{k}2E_\text{max}$$ and for this to hold for any point, distance $r_1,r_2$ from the two sources, $$r_2-r_1=m\lambda \ \ \ \ \ \ (m=0,\pm1,\pm2, \dots)$$
#### ... destructive interference
Wavefronts completely cancel at any point
$$r_2-r_1=(m+\frac{1}{2})\lambda \ \ \ \ \ \ (m=0,\pm1,\pm2, \dots)$$
