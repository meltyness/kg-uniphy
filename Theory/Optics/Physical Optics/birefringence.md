#C33-5 

An [[optical surface properties of materials]] where the [[kind of material]] exhibits different [[index of refraction]] for different [[polarization of optical rays]]. For example [[calcite]] ([[calcium]] [[carbon]] [[oxygen]] $\text{CaCO}_3$). Such a tool, when at a specific width to generate a quarter-period delay for a [[electromagnetic spectrum, frequency of light|wavelength]], $\lambda_0$ is also called a quarter-wave plate.

This also occurs to material under [[stress]] and is called [[photoelastic stress imaging]] #WaitWhat interesting [[task]]. The basic setup is to present [[linearly polarized]] light, circularly polarize it with a quarter-wave plate, pass it through the photoelastic materials, remove the polarization with another quarter-wave plate, and then photograph the system.

Following from #C33-E 33.43, this exhibits [[reversibility]].
