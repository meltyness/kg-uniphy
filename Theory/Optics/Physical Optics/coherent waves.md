#C35-1 

The [[logical|supposition]] or [[task]] that in comparing two [[wave]], (or #Caution alternatively a source of [[light intensity]]) has the following properties:
- [[definite|Definite]], constant [[phase]] (this might be necessary due to [[quantum]] effects)
- Identical [[electromagnetic spectrum, frequency of light|frequency]], and [[monochromatic]] 

It isn't feasible to synchronize two sources of light, so typically to produce this one source of light has its emissions split via:
- [[double-slit experiment]]
- [[interferometer]]
- [[beam splitter]]
- A [[LASER, MASER stimulated light]]
