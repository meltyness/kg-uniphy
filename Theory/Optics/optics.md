[[electromagnetic waves and light|Electromagnetic waves and light]] can be studied and [[explanation|explained]] using optics. Ironically the word meant to refer to [[visible light]], preceding the discovery of the rest of the [[electromagnetic spectrum, frequency of light|spectrum]].

#### ... [[Huygen's principle]]
Relates [[geometric optics]] to [[electromagnetic waves and light]], and is a unified way to explain:

#### ... [[the motion of light, and light propagation]]
Light can be viewed as a [[subatomic particle]], the [[photon]], or approximated as an [[optical ray]], or as a [[electromagnetic waves and light|wave]]. [[quantum electrodynamics]] reconciles the nature of these two descriptions.

#### ... [[geometric optics]]
This provides an approach to [[break down the kinds of behavior into a well-characterized component]].

#### ... [[physical optics]]
Based on the existence of [[superposition of fields]] and that [[electromagnetic waves and light]] are indeed a [[wave]] various effects must be considered in this perspective.

#### ... [[phenomenology]]
- [[light emission]] as [[heat radiation and absorption, thermal radiation]]
	- Consider a [[heating coil]], one can feel [[heat radiation and absorption, thermal radiation|radiation of heat]] before it becomes [[temperature|hot]] enough to glow and emit [[electromagnetic spectrum, frequency of light|red light]].
	- Additionally an [[electrical current]] in an [[AC circuits]] can produce [[electromagnetic waves and light]].
- [[light absorption]] and [[Rayleigh scattering]]
	- On a [[temperature|hot]] day, it is bad to wear a black t-shirt.
- [[quantum]] [[energy]] and [[photon]]
	- [[the motion of light, and light propagation]] 
- [[optical imaging]]
	- much like [[shadow puppetry]], a [[rigid body]] interacts with light, and any interceding [[optical lens]] to produce an [[optical image]], as with a [[camera]], [[telescope]], [[microscope]]

#### Application
- [[medical imaging]]
- [[optical computing]]
- [[telescope]]
- [[LASER, MASER stimulated light]]
- [[fiber optics]]
- [[holograms]]
