#C35-1

An [[electromagnetic waves and light]] exhibits [[superposition of fields]], and therefore also experiences effects in [[analogy]] to [[interference of mechanical waves]]. 


#### ... [[interference of light waves]]
A pair of light waves has, in space, areas of larger amplitude than one alone.

#### ... [[diffraction of light waves]]
How do we describe the result of a [[diffuse reflection]] in terms of the resultant [[coherent waves]] [[interference of light waves|interference]]?

#### [[phenomenology]]
- Recalling that [[the wavefront of light is the locus of all adjacent points at which the phase of vibration of a physical quantity associated with the wave is the same]],
	- it follows due to [[superposition of fields]] for the [[electric field]] and [[magnetic field]] [[displacement]] 
	- therefore the  [[principle of superposition of waves]] that light waves can undergo [[interference of light waves]].
	- #Caution  The [[range of validity]] is limited when the wave is in a very dense medium, such as a [[crystal]].
- This occurs 
	- following from [[Huygen's principle]] through an [[occlude or filter|occluding]] [[thermal contact, material system junction, optical junction or adventure|adventure]]
- ... and details of how [[standing electromagnetic waves]] result from each [[mechanical wave node]] being a point of complete [[interference of light waves]] #Caution this occurs in [[space]] due to [[the motion of light, and light propagation]]


#### Applications
- [[holograms]]
- [[x-ray crystallography]]
- [[emission spectra, absorption spectra and diffraction grating, spectroscopy]]
- The [[optical surface properties of materials]] for [[cavitation]] / bubbles.
