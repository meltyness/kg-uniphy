#C37-4

A type of [[dilation and contraction]].

#### ... [[formula]] [[derivation]]
- In a moving frame $S'$ a [[length]] is [[experiment or measurement|measured]] with a [[electromagnetic waves and light|pulse of light]], an [[atomic clock]], a [[photocell, and photomultiplier]], and an [[optical mirror]] $l_0$
- The [[duration]] observed in $S'$ depends on the [[speed of light]], $c$ $$\Delta t_0 = {2l_0 \over c}$$
- In a stationary frame, $S$
	- The ruler moves with $u$, and we'll call its length $l$
	- A wave pulse takes $\Delta t_1$ to move from the source to the mirror
	- The pulse travels along the [[path]] $$d=l+u\Delta t_1$$
	- And following from [[Einstein's second postulate of special relativity]], $$d=c\Delta t_1$$
	- solving these two equations gives, $$\Delta t_1 = {l \over c-u}$$
	- Similarly on the ways back $$d=l-u\Delta t_2 \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ d=c\Delta t_2$$
	- Solving again, $$\Delta t_2 = {l \over c+u}$$
	- And then taking $\Delta t = \Delta t_1 + \Delta t_2$ and solving $$\Delta t = {l \over c-u} + {l \over c+u} = {2l \over {c(1-u^2/c^2)}}={2l\gamma^2 \over c}$$
	- And with $\Delta t_0 = 2l_0 / c$ and following from [[time dilation]] $${\Delta t \over \gamma}  = {2l_0 \over c}$$
	- With $\Delta t$, $${2l\gamma \over c} = {2 l_0 \over c} \implies l={l_0 \over \gamma}$$
