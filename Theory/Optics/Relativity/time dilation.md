#C37-3

A type of [[dilation and contraction]] of [[duration]] and [[time]]. This effect also leads to a [[twin paradox]].

An argument #ProofDeferred  regarding the cycles of a traveling clock lead to [[time dilation]] and the associated factor, $\gamma$, [[formula]] always, $\Delta t \ge \Delta t_0$ $$\Delta t={\Delta t_0 \over \sqrt{1-u^2/c^2}}=\gamma\Delta t_0$$
