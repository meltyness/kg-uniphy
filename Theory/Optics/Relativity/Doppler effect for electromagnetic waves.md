#C16-8 

The [[Doppler effect]] for [[electromagnetic waves and light]], with $c$ [[speed of light]]. Applied to [[International Space Station]] this can also be used for [[Doppler radar]] so that the [[electromagnetic spectrum, frequency of light]] is measured to vary with [[relative velocity]]. Further this is a limiting case of [[gravitational red shift]].

$$f_R = \sqrt{c-v \over c+v}f_S$$

and by taking $v<<c$ and [[approximating specific complications]],
$$f_R=f_S(1-{v\over c})$$

#### [[formula]] [[derivation]],
#C37-6
- A [[material system]] in [[inertial frame of reference]] $S'$ [[what causes motion, or causality|causes]] [[electromagnetic waves and light|an electromagnetic disturbance]] that is [[experiment or measurement|observed]] by someone in $S$.
	- $S'$ is moving with a [[velocity]], $u$ towards $S$
- The pulses are emitted with $T_0 = 1/f_0$ in $S'$ what [[electromagnetic spectrum, frequency of light|frequency]] is observed in $S$?
- We consider the event that [[crests]] emerge from $S'$ and write $$T=\gamma T_0$$
- blowing the rest of the shit off.
