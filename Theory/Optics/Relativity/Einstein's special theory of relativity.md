#C37-1 
Applies to [[experiment or measurement]] in an [[inertial frame of reference]], and certain [[phenomena of nature|effects]] that take hold near the [[speed of light]]. Considered a [[breakthrough]].

Extended further to [[Einstein's general theory of relativity]]

#### ... [[Einstein's first postulate of special relativity]]
States that
> The laws of physics are the same in every inertial frame of reference.

#### ... [[Einstein's second postulate of special relativity]]
Follows from observation of [[Michelson-Morley experiment]].

> The speed of light in vacuum is the same in every inertial frame of reference, and is independent of any motion of the source.

#### ... [[Lorentz transformation]]
A [[enumerate all apparently permissible configurations|generalization]] of the [[relative velocity]] transformations described previously.

#### ... [[phenomenology]], and [[making predictions with physics|predicted consequences]]
All [[proper]] [[state variable]] are effected by this supposition, and therefore we [[enumerate all apparently permissible configurations|explore the following]]

##### ... and [[simultaneity]]
An argument regarding simultaneity enables us to [[derivation|derive]] details about [[duration]]. Two ob

##### ... and [[duration]]
An argument regarding the cycles of a traveling clock lead to [[time dilation]] and the associated factor, $\gamma$, $\Delta t_0$ is [[proper]] [[time]] $$\Delta t={\Delta t_0 \over \sqrt{1-u^2/c^2}}=\gamma\Delta t_0$$
##### ... and [[displacement]]
Under special relativity, objects and [[displacement]] undergo [[length contraction]]

##### ... and the [[Doppler effect for electromagnetic waves]]
Recalling the the [[Doppler effect]] depended on [[relative velocity]], and [[experiment or measurement]] would differ from prediction for that result, we discuss.

##### ... and [[momentum]]
Due to the [[Lorentz transformation]] forming the [[Einstein's first postulate of special relativity|invariant]] [[kinematics in space]], momentum also changes its meaning, we also introduce the concept of [[rest mass]] and has the [[formula]] #ProofDeferred $$\vec{p} = \gamma m_0 \vec{v}$$
##### ... and [[Newton's second law of motion]], [[force]]
#Caution this can only follow from the momentum formulation above.

Recalling from [[dynamics of rigid bodies]] and [[impulse-momentum theorem]] that this law can be written $\vec{F} = d\vec{p}/dt$, then it follows that in relativity for [[kinematics along a straight line]],$$\vec{F} = {d \over dt}{m\vec{v} \over \sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}} \implies a = {F \over m}(1-{v^2\over c^2})^{3/2} \implies F_{||}=\gamma^3ma$$
but for [[kinematics of rotational motion of rigid bodies]] as in a [[cyclotron]], we find instead, since $\vec{F}\perp \vec{v}$ and therefore $|\vec{v}|=v \mapsto \text{ constant}$. and the derivation instead gives $$F_\perp=\gamma m a$$
In general, otherwise we must use [[kinematics in space#acceleration in space|acceleration and curvature relationship]] to glean details about the system for $F_\perp, F_{||}$.

[[unless the net force on a relativistic particle is either along the same line as the particle's velocity or perpendicular to it, the net force and acceleration vectors are not parallel]]

##### ... and [[mass]]
Following from the arguments regarding momentum, especially useful when extending to [[intermolecular and interatomic forces]] $$m={m_0\gamma}$$
##### ... and [[energy]] 
We maintain the definition of [[work]], $W=\int F_x \ dx$ assuming no force in other directions. $$W=\int_{x_1}^{x_2}F \ dx = \int_{x_1}^{x_2} {{ma \ dx} \over (1-v^2/c^2)^{3/2}}$$
Recalling that [[kinetic energy]] and work have [[work-energy theorem]] so starting [[at rest]] and using [change of variables](obsidian://open?vault=Calculus%20Review&file=Function%20Calculus%2FOperations%2FIntegration%2FSubstitution%20Rule), $$W=Fdx=\int_0^v{{mv_x\ dv_x} \over (1-v_x^2/c^2)^{3/2}}={mc^2 \over \sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}-mc^2=(\gamma-1)mc^2$$
##### ... and [[total mechanical energy]], [[mass-energy equivalence]]
With $K =(\gamma - 1)mc^2$ we intuit that there's an intrinsic energy identified, and taking $v\rightarrow 0$, $$E=K+mc^2=\gamma mc^2\implies E_0=mc^2$$
An concretely by [[experiment or measurement]] a [[pion]] with $m_\pi$ decays into [[heat radiation and absorption, thermal radiation]] as an [[electromagnetic waves and light]], and at rest this is measured to be $m_\pi c^2$

##### ... and [[law of conservation of energy]]
In general #ProofDeferred,$$E^2=(mc^2)^2 + (pc)^2$$
and for a non-[[material]] (zero [[rest mass]]) particle such as a [[photon]], $$E=pc$$
