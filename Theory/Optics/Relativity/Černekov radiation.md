#C37-E 

A kind of [[heat radiation and absorption, thermal radiation]] due to [[motion involving electrical charges]] at [[relativity|ultrarelativistic]] [[speed]], and [[energy]]. 

Consider that due to the [[index of refraction]] of a [[material system]] [[electromagnetic waves and light]] may have $v<c$, the [[speed of light]], and an effect [[analogy|similar]] to [[shockwave, or sonic boom]] is observed.
