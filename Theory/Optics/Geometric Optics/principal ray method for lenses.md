#C34-4 

To [[find a linearly independent set characterizing the system]] we follow this method to establish [[object-image relationship]] for an [[optical lens]].

#### ... [[derivation]]
- We neglect [[aberration]] that may occur.
- Recalling that $F_2$ is beyond a [[converging lens]] and precedes a [[diverging lens]].
- We select the following four [[optical ray]] from an object that is *not* lying on the [[optical axis]].
	- A ray parallel to the axis to intersect the [[focal point, and focal length]] $F_2$ 
		- but only virtually so, in the case of a diverging lens.
	- A ray to the [[optical vertex]] which isn't deflected.
	- A ray towards $F_1$ emerges parallel
		- but the ray will be deflected before reaching $F_1$ in a diverging lens.
