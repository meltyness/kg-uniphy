#C34-1 

In general this captures
- the relationship between [[object distance]] and [[image distance]], $s, s'$ 
- this can establish the [[focal point, and focal length]], $f$ 
- whether the [[optical image]] 
	- is a [[real image]] 
	- or a [[virtual image]]
- The [[optical magnification]] and whether the [[optical image]] 
	- is [[optically erect]], 
	- or [[optically inverted]]
- Presumably a sufficiently detailed analysis can also determine
	- [[aberration]]
