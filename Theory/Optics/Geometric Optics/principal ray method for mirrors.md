#C34-2 
To [[find a linearly independent set characterizing the system]] we follow this method to establish [[object-image relationship]] for a [[mirror]]. 

Notice also that we test 4 rays to distinguish 4 operating modes:
- Image inverted and real, $m<0$ (beyond $C$)
- Image inverted and real, $m<0$ (both at $C$)
- Image at infinity (at $f$) also known as [[collimated]] which must be analyzed via [[angular size]]
	- see [[optical magnification]]
- Image erect and virtual $m>0$ (with $s < f$)

#### ... [[derivation]]
- We neglect [[aberration]] that may occur.
- With
	- The [[sign rules of geometric optics]] determined / a concave or convex mirror
	- The [[center of curvature]] and hence the [[focal point, and focal length|focal length]]
	- an [[extended object]] at $Q$, or otherwise *not* lying on the [[optical axis]].
- We select the following four [[optical ray]] 
	- A ray parallel to the axis 
		- is reflected
		- Passes through the [[focal point, and focal length|focal point]]
		- Passes through the [[real image]] or appears to come from the [[virtual image]]
	- A ray through the [[focal point, and focal length]] 
		- is reflected
		- Parallel to the axis
		- Passes through the [[real image]] or appears to come from the [[virtual image]]
	- A ray parallel to the [[material surface normal]] or equivalently, throug the [[center of curvature]].
		- is reflected
		- Passes through the [[real image]] or appears to come from the [[virtual image]]
		- Straight back to $Q$
	- A ray to the [[optical vertex]]
		- is reflected
		- Passes through the [[real image]] or appears to come from the [[virtual image]]		
		- Passes through $-Q$ reflected across the axis.

#ThumbRule 
>"para, para, para *dice*"

It's parallel to the axis,
The reflection is parallel to the axis,
It's parallel to the normal,
It's split 50-50, like a coinflip or a dice roll.
