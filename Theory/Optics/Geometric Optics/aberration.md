#C33-2 

A [[disaster]] relating to the [[object-image relationship]] of an [[optical lens]], where the relationship is not simple, typically as producing a [[dilation and contraction]].

Resolved with a [[cascade]] of additional [[optical lens]] called corrective optics.

Another such form may be [[optical junction refractive dispersion]] and [[chromatic aberration]].


#### Spherical aberration
The [[optical image]] is [[disaster|blurred]] when formed by a [[optical mirror]] that is modeled via the [[paraxial approximation for a spherical mirror]].

[[optical ray]] [[in parallel]] strike the mirror far from the [[optical axis]] have a widely varies [[focal point, and focal length]], this would seem to vary with longitudinal [[optical magnification]].
