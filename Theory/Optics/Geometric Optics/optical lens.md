#C34-2 

A [[build, or part]] of an [[optics]] [[machine]] such as a [[telescope]] intended primarily to produce [[dilation and contraction]] of compositions of [[extended object]].


### ... for [[law of light transmission, and refraction|refractive]]-type lenses
#### ... for a single spherical [[optical surface properties of materials|refractive surface]]
Wrapped into [[derivation of a spherical and planar refractive lens]]
$${n_a \over s} + {n_b \over s'}={(n_b-n_a) \over R} \ \ \ \ \ \ \ m={-n_as' \over n_bs}$$
#### ... for a thin double spherical lens
We have two [[enumerate all apparently permissible configurations|classes]] differentiated by the following:

[[any lens that is thicker at its center than at its edges is a converging lens with positive focal length, otherwise it is a diverging lens with negative width]]

#### ... [[enumerate all apparently permissible configurations|common classes of lenses]]

- [[converging lens]], paraxial rays collapse to the focal point
- [[diverging lens]], paraxial rays appear to source from the focal point.

And in general these are characterized by [[the lensmaker's equation]], and finally [[principal ray method for lenses]]
