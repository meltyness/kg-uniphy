#C34-1

A [[material system]] in optics which interacts with [[the motion of light, and light propagation]] in that it produces [[light emission]] as [[law of light transmission, and refraction|refraction]], [[law of specular reflection|specular reflection]], [[diffuse reflection]], and so on.

#### ... [[optical lens]]
One of two chief [[abstract negligible facets|component of an optical system]] resulting in the need for [[geometric optics]].

#### ... [[optical mirror]]
The other component of an [[optical instrument]].

#### ... [[optical image]]
The result of an [[enumerate all apparently permissible configurations|optical event]]. It is also worth noting that due to the diffuse nature of [[optical ray]] that [[the geometry of the optical image is not effected by the partial occlusion of the optical components, only the intensity is]]

#### ... [[phenomenology]]
- The [[material system]], [[rigid body]], or another [[optical image]] as a composition of [[extended object]], which in turn can be considered to be a collection of [[point object]].
	- An [[optical image]] can serve as the objective for another [[thermal contact, material system junction, optical junction or adventure|junction]], [[principle of image transitivity]].
- Consider such a point object [[light emission|emitting]] [[optical ray]] [[Huygen's principle|in all directions]], and any intercedent [[thermal contact, material system junction, optical junction or adventure|optical junctions]]
- An [[optical lens]] produces an [[optical image]] of such a situation, and is described by its [[object-image relationship]] in terms of the [[object distance]], [[image distance]].



#### Applications
- [[magnifying mirror]]
- [[surveillance mirror]]
- [[radio]] [[telescope]].
- [[non-line-of-site imaging]]
