#C34-1 
The optical image is how [[optics]] interacts with an [[extended object]].

##### ... for a [[virtual image]]
In a virtual image the emitted rays do not pass through the image points
- A planar [[mirror]] exhibiting specular reflection with [[law of specular reflection]] produces a virtual [[image point]] behind it as the apparent source.
	- For a [[diffuse reflection]] rays reach the observer, but a virtual point is not established.
- Under [[law of light transmission, and refraction]] a virtual image is also formed from the rays external to the boundary.

##### ... for a [[real image]]
For real images, the [[thermal contact, material system junction, optical junction or adventure|junction-emitted]] rays *do* pass through the image points.
