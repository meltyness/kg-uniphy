#C38-7 

In [[subatomic particle collisions]] and [[quantum mechanics]] the consideration of similar interactions of [[energy]] and [[momentum]] applying to different [[elementary entities]]. 

Since populations can be quantified via [[Maxwell-Boltzmann Distribution]] these effects can then be figured on the basis of [[how much on average]] they effect [[physical quantities]].
