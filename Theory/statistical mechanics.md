#C18-1

In the case where we can only make [[experiment or measurement|indirect observations]], then, only as [[time]] progresses can the [[models]] used for  [[making predictions with physics]] be [[precision, accuracy, uncertainty, and significant figures|precise]].

- [[order and disorder]]
- [[molecular motion]]
- [[ideal gas]]
- [[free expansion]] / [[molecular diffusion]]

#### [[hypotheses]] in statistical mechanics have a particular form
- [[how often]]
- [[how much on average]]
- [[what is the shape of the probability density]]

#### [[distinction, and indistinguishability]]
[[Maxwell's Demon]] presents a [[duality]] regarding this.
