#C38-7 

A type of feed-forward [[task|effect]] where an [[incident]] [[photon]], [[subatomic particle]], [[atomic speciation, nuclides, isotope|nuclide]] produces an [[intermolecular motion of charges]], [[atom excitation lifetime]], or possibly [[nuclear reactions]] which in turn produces further [[emission]] such as a [[photon]], depending on the kind of scattering.

Broadly, a type of [[collision]], results in [[diffuse reflection]].

- [[Compton scattering]] valid for $f = \mathcal{O}(mc^2/h)$ more general cases,
	- [[Rutherford scattering]] for non-[[photon]] a [[correspondence principle, and perturbation theory|limiting case]] of Compton scattering (i.e., [[alpha particles]] or [[electrons]])
- [[Rayleigh scattering]] for [[photon]]
- [[neutron scattering]]
