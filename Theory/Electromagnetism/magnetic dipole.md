A magnetic dipole is a loop of [[electrical current]] in a [[electrical conductivity, and resistivity|conductor]] such that a [[magnetic field]] will cause a [[torque]], similar to the [[electrical dipole]], has a [[magnetic flux]]

#### ... definition and [[formula]]
We define a [[magnetic moment]], $\mu$ normal to the direction of the [[electrical current]]. #WaitWhat 
 does this really generalize to any area? #ProofDeferred this follows from an argument [[hold on is this green's theorem whats going on here|similar to the one provided regarding adiabatic thermodynamic process, path]]. Note that the direction of the surface normal, $\vec{A}$ is with the [[right-hand rule]] of the electric current. $$\vec{\mu} = I\vec{A}$$
 The torque experienced by such a loop is $$\vec{\tau} = \vec{\mu} \times \vec{B}$$
similar to our discussion of the [[electrical dipole#torque due to a uniform field]].

And the [[potential energy]] is also $$U = -\vec{\mu} \cdot \vec{B}$$
#### ... in a non-uniform $\vec{B}$
We take the [[differential equation, or principle]] $$d\vec{F} = I d\vec{l} \times \vec{B}$$
and consider the $\vec{B}$ at each point separately.

#### Applications
- [[electric motor]]
- [[solenoid, and current loops]]
