Simply, [[The electric force on a charged body is exerted by the electric field created by other charged bodies]]

#### ... [[Coulomb's law]]
Charged bodies obey this [[inverse square law]], and leads naturally to the concept of the [[electric field]]. This describes how charged bodies [[action-reaction pair|react]] to a field.

#### ... [[electrostatic interactions]]
When the [[electric charge]] is [[at rest]]

#### ... [[electrical potential energy]], [[voltage, or electric potential]], and [[electric-potential gradient]]
Using [[energy]] for [[making predictions with physics]] about electrical interactions.

#### ... [[Gauss's law]]
Using a [[test volume]] we [[employ deductive reasoning|deduce]] details about the field.
