#### ... [[derivation]] of the [[formula]]
With a voltage drop $V_\text{ab} = V_a - V_b$ across an arbitrary [[electrical circuit element]], and a current $I$. As $q$ passes through $U = qV_\text{ab}$ goes into the element, or if $V_b > V_a$ back into the circuit.

$dQ = I \ dt$ passed through, and $V_\text{ab} dQ = V_\text{ab} I \ dt$ can be rearranged into the [[power]] difference,
$$P=V_\text{ab}I$$
#### ... re-arranged for [[Ohm's law|ohmic]] devices
$$P = V_\text{ab}I=I^2R = {V_\text{ab}^2 \over I}$$
#### ... for a [[electromotive force, and ideal voltage source#formula for the internal resistor resistance model|source with internal resistance]]
Straightforwardly,$$P=\mathcal{E}I-I^2r$$
#### ... for an [[alternator]] charging [[batteries]]
Similarly $$V_\text{ab} = \mathcal{E}+Ir$$
and it follows that $$P=\mathcal{E}I+I^2R$$
where $I^2R$ is doing [[work]] and delivering power to the battery.

#### ... for an [[AC circuits#in terms of power dissipation energy|AC Circuit power dissipation]]
We start from $$p = vi$$
