Within the scope of [[electrical current]], we can also consider the [[concentration]] of [[elementary entities]].

#### [[derivation]]
With a concentration $n$ [[electric charge freedom|free charges]] $1/\text{m}^3$, all with a [[electrical drift velocity]] $v_d$ in a [[duration]] $dt$ each [[elementary entities]] with charge $q$ moves a [[displacement]] of $v_d \ dt$ we can write the [[differential equation, or principle]] as a [[formula]], $$dQ = nqv_dA \ dt$$
and with $$J = {I \over A} = nqv_d$$
we find an expression for current, and a [[vector quantity]], $$\vec{J} = nq\vec{v}_d$$ which can help us [[making predictions with physics|predict]] [[electrical properties of materials]] based on things like 
- [[electrical dipole]] of [[molecular geometry]]
- [[material mixture]] [[concentration]]
- [[kind of material]]
