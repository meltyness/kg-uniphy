#C25-1 

A type of [[flux]] of the [[random motion]] of [[electrons]] in a [[material system]] modeled as a [[electrical conductivity, and resistivity|conductor]].

This can be measured with an [[ammeter]]

#### ... [[formula]]
The current past a cross-section (like a [[flux]]) is given by $$I = {dQ \over dt}$$
And it has the [[SI units]] the [[ampere]]. 

#### ... more analytical considerations
- We can also arrive at a [[current density]]
- a figure called [[electrical conductivity, and resistivity]] follows from that analysis.

#### ... [[phenomenology]]
- In a [[metal]], [[metals are generally better conductors]] because they have a high [[concentration]] of [[electric charge freedom|free charges]]. These electrons undergo [[random motion]] at on order $\approx 10^6 \text{ m / s}$ #ThumbRule 
- It follows that [[how much on average|on average]] there is zero motion in any direction, there is no total [[superposition|net flow]].
- When an [[electric field]] is introduced, and established inside the conductor, each of the [[elementary entities]] experiences the [[electromagnetic interaction]] with $\vec{F} = q\vec{E}$. 
- This *would* cause an [[acceleration]] 
	- however instead because of the [[subatomic particle collisions]] with the [[material system]] of in the [[material system]] acting as the conductor, the entities undergo [[random direction changes]]
- An [[electrical drift velocity]] appears in the direction of the force, $\vec{v}_d$ with $|\vec{v}_d| \approx 10^{-4} \text{ m/s}$ #ThumbRule 
- As a result there is a current in the conductor.
- Because the [[electric field propagation]] happens near the [[speed of light]], the slow $v_d$ doesn't mean it takes as long for the [[energy]] to appear at each [[electrical circuit element]].
- The [[subatomic particle collisions]] produce [[thermal energy]] in the material of the conductor, preventing acceleration.

#### ... variable situations
- Different [[kind of material]] results in different [[elementary entities]]
	- In metals, the [[electrons]] are typically best suited to move.
	- In [[plasma]], the [[electronic configuration, and ionization|ionized atoms]] and [[electrons]] are all motile.
	- In [[semiconductors]], called a [[electric hole]] carries charge, (see [[Hall effect]]).
- #WaitWhat kind of [[task]] does this correspond to? #ConstructorTheory 
	- Finding paths through a non-topological maze appears to be contingent on Gaussian Elimination, O(n^3), 
	- This can be extended to a higher dimension increasing the crossing number of the circuit, but the task doesn't change.
