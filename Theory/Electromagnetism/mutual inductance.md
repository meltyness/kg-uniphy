#C30-1

Each loop of a coil with a time-varying current, $i(t)$ places an [[electromotive force, and ideal voltage source|emf]] on the following, based on [[Faraday's law of induction]]:  $$\mathcal{E}=\oint\vec{E}\cdot d\vec{l} = {-d\Phi_B \over dt}$$
So with two coils, a current $i_1$ produces a $B$ field at coil $2$ so that: $$\mathcal{E}_2 = -N_2{d\Phi_{B2} \over dt}$$ and we relate $\Phi_{B2}$ to $i_1$ with $M_{1 \cap 2}$ a proportionality constant so that, $$N_2\Phi_{B2} = M_{1\cup2}i_1 \implies$$$$N_2{d\Phi_{B2} \over dt} = M_{1\cup2}{di_1 \over dt}$$
and it follows then that $$\mathcal{E}_2 = M_{1 \cup 2}{di_1 \over dt}$$... and has [[SI units]] of the [[henry]].
