The motion is determined by [[Newton's laws of motion]]. Consider that this also leads to many of the [[magnetic properties of materials]].

#### ... forces between [[in parallel]] [[electrical current]] on [[electrical conductivity, and resistivity|conductors]]
From [[Biot-Savart law]], the field due to $I$ is $$B={\mu_0I \over 2\pi r}$$
at a distance $r$ from the conductor, and [[Ørsted-Laplace-Thomson law]], $\vec{F}=I'\vec{L}\times\vec{B}$

since they are parallel, current in the same direction, then the force is [[attraction]] onto the conductor carrying $I'$, with$$F=I'LB=I'L\bigg({\mu_0I \over 2\pi r}\bigg)$$
If current were opposite, the force would be [[repulsion]]. [[its impossible to produce ternary attraction with an equilateral triangle of currents]]

If the magnetic force cannot do work on the charges, but the wire can still move in the same direction as the magnetic force, there is a [[duality]] regarding the [[work]]-[[energy]] relationship.

It might be best to think about [[work]] in this situation as it relates to either [[electrical drift velocity]], and [[subatomic particle collisions]],

or ...

#### ... the [[Hall effect]]
A way to [[models|quantify]] the effect of a magnetic field on a conductor with a current.

#### ... as a [[torque]] on a [[electrical conductivity, and resistivity|conductor]] [[loop]] ([[magnetic dipole]])
[[the net force on a current loop in a uniform magnetic field is zero, but the net torque is not]]

A magnetic dipole is a current loop, that will rotate with [[torque]] as in an [[electric motor]].

In a square section of loop, the magnitude of torque is: $$\tau = IBA\sin\phi$$
and we boil down $IA$ (the current, and area in the loop) to the [[magnetic dipole]], for the more general forms: $$\vec{\tau} = \vec{\mu} \times \vec{B} \ \ \ \ \ \ \text{and} \ \ \ \ U = -\vec{\mu}\cdot\vec{B}$$
and for a constant current, this holds for any looping geometry, since we can [[hold on is this green's theorem whats going on here|approximate any closed loop as a sum of closed rectangles]]. This should be interpreted to mean that the direction of the torque depends on the magnetic moment, and the direction of the field.

#WaitWhat if you produce a loop that is three-dimensional, rather than two-dimensional, how does this shake out?

#### ... on an [[electrical current]] in a [[electrical conductivity, and resistivity|conductor]]
#C27-6
The forces on moving charges within the conductor are transmitted to the [[material system]] composing the conductor, and it experiences a [[force]] on its [[length]].

This can be derived from the [[Ørsted-Laplace-Thomson law]], $$\vec{F} = I \vec{l} \times \vec{B} \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \text{(magnetic force onto a segment)}$$
Or in general the [[path]] [[integral]] similar to the [[magnetic dipole#in a non-uniform vec B|magnetic dipole in a non uniform field]]$$\vec{F} = \int_P d\vec{F} = \int_P I d\vec{l} \times \vec{B}$$
#### ... [[subatomic particle]] in a steady magnetic field
This results in [[kinematics of circular motion]], following [[Newton's laws of motion]].

The action of a steady [[magnetic field]] results in circular motion with constant speed. 
- [[a magnetic field can never do work on a particle]]. 
- [[motion of a charged particle under the action of a magnetic field alone always has constant speed]]

It's easy to show that the [[radius]] of such motion is (noticing the appearance of a [[momentum]] term,) $$R={mv \over |q|B}={p \over |q|B}$$
From [[rolling]], $v=R\omega$ yields [[formula]] $$\omega = {|q|B \over m}$$
this is called the [[cyclotron]] [[angular frequency|frequency]]. This effect is also used in a [[magnetron]]. 

This results in a [[helix]] shape, if the [[subatomic particle]] being acted on had an initial [[velocity]] [[in parallel]] with the [[magnetic field]].
