#C27-9

The [[electromagnetic interaction]] act on [[electric charge]] in an [[electrical current]] with [[electrical conductivity, and resistivity|conductivity]], similar to the motion by $\vec{B}$ on [[electrons]] in a [[cathode ray tube]] or [[control grid, velocity selector]].

Supports building a [[measurement device]] for the
- [[electrical drift velocity]]
- [[polarity]] of the [[elementary entities]] carrying the main [[electrical current]].

#### ... [[derivation]] of [[formula]]
- A flat strip of [[metal]] with [[electrical current]] in the $+x$ direction.
- A uniform [[magnetic field]] in the $+y$ direction
- A [[electrical drift velocity]] $v_d$ on charges with $|q|$
- Each charge has $F=|q|v_dB$ following from [[magnetic interaction]] or [[Ã˜rsted-Laplace-Thomson law]]
- Based on the force, $E=v_dB$ and $J_x=nqv_d$ following from [[current density]].
- Due to the [[displacement]] of [[electric charge]] a type of [[material system charge polarization]] appears and a [[voltage, or electric potential]] exists between the opposite sides.
- This discovery leads to the understanding of [[electric hole]] as an [[elementary entities]] or [[electric charge freedom|free charges]] in [[semiconductors]], because the [[polarity]] of the voltage depends on the [[polarity]] of the carrier.
- The hall-effect relationship, in total is: $$nq = {-J_xB_y \over E_z}$$
- Presumably this is the funamental reason for the [[task]] at which [[semiconductors]] seem to excel at, [[distinction, and indistinguishability]]
- Additionally, notice that the distinction drawn before regarding 
	- High [[concentration]], low [[electrical drift velocity|drift]] [[metal]] imply less effect
	- Low [[concentration]], high [[electrical drift velocity|drift]] [[semiconductors|semis]] imply much greater hall effect.
- There are also [[quantum]] effects to consider, as well as [[subatomic particle collisions]].

But generally, think [[control grid, velocity selector]].
