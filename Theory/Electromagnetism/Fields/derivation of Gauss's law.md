Starting with [[Coulomb's law]], $$E = {1 \over 4\pi\epsilon_0}{q \over R^2}$$
observing that for a circle of radius $R$ we'll have $$\Phi_E = EA = {1 \over 4\pi\epsilon_0}{q \over R^2}(4\pi R^2) = {q \over \epsilon_0}$$
[[the flux through a sphere is independent of the radius]]

In order to extend this to a [[potato]], we use the [[potato extension technique]] described below:

- Surround the sphere with radius $R$ with and irregular shape.
- Draw a ray that is $R+r$ from the charge. Where $r$ is the distance from the sphere to the potato.
- The point of intersection is on the potato's surface $dA$ 
- If the ray, $R+r$ makes an angle $\phi$ with the normal of $dA$ then if we project $dA$ back onto the sphere we can do so as a rectangle scaled via [[foreshortening]], [[shadow puppetry]] in one direction by $\cos\phi$
- If $r$ is quite small, so that the $E$ field doesn't vary between a test sphere and the potato,
- The flux through that potato surface element, is $$d\Phi_E = dA\ ( E \cos\phi)$$
- and on the sphere we have $$ d\Phi_E=(dA\cos\phi)E $$
- So following from the simpler argument $$\Phi_E = \oint\vec{E}\cdot d\vec{A}={q \over \epsilon_0}$$
We also conclude [[electric field lines can begin or end inside a region of space only when there is charge in that region]]

[[the total electric flux through a closed surface is equal to the total (net) electric charge inside the surface, divided by the permittivity]]
