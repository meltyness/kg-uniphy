In [[Faraday's law of induction]] these can be produced in any [[electrical conductivity, and resistivity|conductor]] moving through a [[magnetic field]] following from motional [[electromotive force, and ideal voltage source|emf]] $$\mathcal{E}=\oint(\vec{v}\times\vec{B})\cdot d\vec{l}$$
In [[celestial mechanics]] this causes the high [[temperature]] of [[Io]], can be used in [[locomotion]] for [[braking]], also used for [[metal detectors]], [[dampened oscillation]] for providing [[human control]] of [[kinematics of rotational motion of rigid bodies]].

One can draw an [[analogy]] to [[fluid resistance]] as well, since this is proportional to [[velocity]], and the phenomena produces a [[dissipative force]] opposing motion.
