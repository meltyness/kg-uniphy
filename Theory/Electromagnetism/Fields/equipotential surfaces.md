#C23-4

When all [[electric charge]] is [[at rest]] (an [[electrostatic interactions]]) the [[surface]] of a [[electrical conductivity, and resistivity]] is always an equipotential surface.

- [[when all electric charge is at rest the surface of a conductor is always an equipotential surface]]
- [[two equipotential surfaces may never intersect]]

And an equipotential surface needn't be [orientable](obsidian://open?vault=Calculus%20Review&file=Multivariable%20Calculus%2FOperations%2FSurface%20integrals) #WaitWhat  is this the same shape as a [[p orbital]]?

See [[field]] for the mathematical treatment.
