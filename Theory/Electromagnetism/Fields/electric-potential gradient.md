Similar to [[temperature gradient]] $$\vec{E} = -\vec{\nabla}V=-<\hat{i}{\partial V \over \partial x}, \ \hat{j}{\partial V \over \partial y},\ \hat{k}{\partial V \over \partial z}>$$

#Caution [[range of validity]] can depend on how these were computed for a [[assume common, reasonable system geometry|given geometry]]
