#C27-3

A line where $\vec{B}$ is always [[tangent]] to the [[magnetic field]] are called the magnetic field lines. A two-dimensional cross section is called a field map.

The direction shows you the direction along which a [[magnetic compass]] would align #Caution 
 **not** the direction of force!!

Field lines always start and end at the same point forming loops, because [[it's impossible to create a magnetic monopole]].
