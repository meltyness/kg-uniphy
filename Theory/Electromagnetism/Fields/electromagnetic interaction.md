[[Coulomb's law]] is that $F_e \propto 1 / r^2$ , an [[inverse square law]].

Involve [[subatomic particle]] with [[electric charge]]. Fundamentally these forces are the cause of [[intermolecular and interatomic forces]] in any [[material system]].

Ultimately interesting for the cause of [[electromagnetic waves and light]]

#### [[Maxwell's laws]]
Describes unified, these fields.

#### [[Lorentz force]]
Describes the forces onto a charge from these fields. Combines [[Ã˜rsted-Laplace-Thomson law]], and forces due to [[Coulomb's law]]

#### ... [[motion involving electrical charges]]
unifies the two phenomena, funamentally an electric charge in motion produces a [[magnetic field]], and another moving charge responds to it, and experiences the magnetic force. Importantly, this gives rise to the utility of [[complete electrical circuit|electrical circuits]].

#### ... [[electromagnetic induction]]
Used in an [[alternator]], [[electrical transformers]], to present [[electromotive force, and ideal voltage source|electromotive force]] via time-varying [[magnetic field]].

#### ... the [[electrical interaction]]
A [[net charge]] produces an [[electric field]], and experiencs [[force]] due to the field produced by other objects.

#### ... the [[magnetic interaction]]
A [[net charge]] with a [[velocity]] produces a [[magnetic field]], and experiences [[force]] due to the field produced by other objects.

#### ... relation to [[strong interaction]]
Because of the existence of strong electromagnetic forces at the range of the [[nucleus]], and the matching [[electric charge]] we would expect [[repulsion]]. Since we instead [[describe outcomes]] as [[attraction]] we can [[employ deductive reasoning]] to determine that a stronger attractive force is present, hence the [[strong interaction]]

#### Applications
- [[spark]]
- [[flashlight]]
- [[television]]
- [[telephone]]
- [[nuclear fission]]
