#C27-2 

An [[electric charge]] in motion produces a magnetic field. The magnetic field exerts a force $\vec{F}$ on any other moving charge (including [[electrical current]]). A [[vector quantity]] and [[physical quantities]]

#C28-E
> ... there is no such thing as an infinitely long *anything*. #ThumbRule 

Also called the [[magnetic flux]] [[density]] [[formula|when written as]].

$$ B = {d\phi_B \over dA_\perp}$$

The [[force]] due to the magnetic field can be found with [[Ørsted-Laplace-Thomson law]], and the field typically represented with $\vec{B}$ is measured in [[SI units]] [[tesla]]

In addition to a [[magnetic compass]] for making cursory measurements we can use a [[cathode ray tube]] to be more precise.

#### ... as [[magnetic field lines]]
These aren't as intuitive to use, just remember to correctly apply [[Ørsted-Laplace-Thomson law]].

#### ... relation to [[Biot-Savart law]]
Most fields can be computed using this easily with integration. #WaitWhat is there an equivalent to [[Earnshaw's theorem]] where Biot-Savart is more general than what is truly permissible?

#### ... expressed as [[Ampere's law]]
Provides a symmetry approach to computing the magnetic field for a given [[motion involving electrical charges]].
