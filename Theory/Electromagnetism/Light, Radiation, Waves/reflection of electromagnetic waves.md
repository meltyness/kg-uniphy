Finally the [[index of refraction]] and observation implies that [[law of light transmission, and refraction]] and [[reflection of electromagnetic waves]] can happen simultaneously at a [[wave medium boundary]], [[analogy]] to #WaitWhat #GotIt how the [[dynamics of mechanical waves]] changes with [[mass density]].

#### ... types of [[wave medium boundary]]
Complete reflectors
- [[electrical conductivity, and resistivity|electrical conductors]] (see [[standing electromagnetic waves#phenomenology]])

Partial reflectors
- A [[thermal contact, material system junction, optical junction or adventure|material system junction]] between two materials with differing
	- [[dielectric, and dielectric strength]]
	- [[magnetic properties of materials]]

#### ... relation to [[electrical current]]
Utilizing the definition of [[current density]], $$J={E \over \rho}$$ we find the following [[formula]] for the [[wave equation]] in that case, $${\partial^2E_y(x,t) \over \partial x^2} = {\mu \over \rho}{\partial E_y(x,t) \over \partial t}$$
#### ... as [[law of specular reflection]]
This defines how to understand the geometry of the [[path]] of incident waves.

[[light intensity]] under [[reflection|reflection]] varies with 
- [[incident]] angle 
	- it is a minimum at the [[material surface normal]] 
	- it also varies sharply with the [[law of total internal reflection]]
- The two material's [[index of refraction]] [[Brewster's law]]
	- #WaitWhat is this a ratio? difference? some other relationship?
- [[electromagnetic wave polarization]]
