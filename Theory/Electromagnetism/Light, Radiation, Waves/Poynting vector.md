#C32-4

A type of [[power]] [[flux]] ([[wave intensity]], [[light intensity]]) of an [[electromagnetic waves and light]]. Light is a [[traveling wave]] which carries [[energy]], from one [[test volume]] to another. A [[physical quantities]] [[vector quantity]].

#### ... [[derivation]] 
We [[establish a test volume or area|establish a test area]] the [[wavefront]], and consider the [[energy density]] there $$dU=u \ dV = \epsilon_0 E^2 Ac \ dt$$ and so establishing power per-unit area, and following from [[speed of light]], and the $E=cB$ constraint applying to any electromagnetic wave, $$S = {1 \over A}{dU \over dt}={\epsilon_0 E^2c}={EB \over \mu_0}$$
we also arrive at a [[vector quantity]], $$\vec{S} = {1 \over \mu}\vec{E}\times\vec{B}$$And this relates simply to delivered [[power]] by:
$$P = \oint\vec{S}\cdot d\vec{A}$$
Since $\vec{S}$ is generally a [[function]] of [[time]], we want to be able to relate the scale much like how [[AC circuits#in terms of power dissipation energy]] and so the [[light intensity]], $I$ is the [[average]], and for [[sinusoidal waves]], $$I=S_\text{av}={E_\text{max}B_\text{max} \over 2\mu}={E_\text{max}^2 \over 2 \mu_0 c}\implies$$
and alternatively, $$=\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{\epsilon_0 \over \mu_0}E_\text{max}^2=\frac{1}{2}\epsilon_0cE_\text{max}^2$$
So,$$I=S_\text{av} = {1 \over T}\int_0^T|\vec{S}|\ dt$$

#Caution unlike [[mechanical waves and work, power, energy]] since the wave is composed of two [[tropographic|separate]] [[wave medium]], special considerations take effect.

#### Applications
- [[photocell, and photomultiplier]]
