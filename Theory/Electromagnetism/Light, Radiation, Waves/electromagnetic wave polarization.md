#C33-5

Another type of [[transmitted]] [[phenomena of nature]] in the study of [[geometric optics]] and [[electromagnetic waves and light]].

#### ... [[phenomenology]]
- [[electromagnetic wave polarization]] is determined by the orientation of $\vec{E}$
- We can [[occlude or filter]] using [[polarization of optical rays]]
- [[approximating specific complications]] light only polarized in one direction is [[linearly polarized]].
- As an [[analogy]] to [[mechanical waves]], a physical slot can polarize them and be modeled as a [[slip-ring|slip-ring type]] [[wave medium boundary]].

#### Applications
- A [[radio]] in [[communications]] typically produces polarized
	- Horizontal in the US, vertical in the UK
- An [[incandescent light bulbs]] typically produces non-polarized light.
