For [[electromagnetic waves and light]] under [[heat radiation and absorption, thermal radiation]], we develop a [[pressure]] formulation from the [[Poynting vector]], $${1 \over A}{dp \over dt} = {S \over c}={EB \over \mu c} \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \text{(flow rate of electromagnetic momentum)}$$
#### ... [[formula]] [[derivation]]
So following from the magnitude of the [[Poynting vector]], $S=EB/\mu_0$, with [[field momentum]] #WaitWhat where is the derivation of this momentum, $p$?

#WaitWhat  does this really depend on [[mass-energy equivalence]]? $$E=mc^2\implies{Ec=pc^2}\implies p={E/c}$$
So from $S\propto \text{W/m}^2 = \text{J/(sm}^2)$ and from $c=\lambda f$ it follows that the momentum in a volume of wavelength$$p = {S(A/f)\over c}={S(A\lambda/c) \over c}\implies {p \over A\lambda} ={S \over c^2}$$ so it follows then that the momentum density is $${dp \over dV} ={S \over c^2}={EB \over \mu c^2}$$
$dV$ is occupied by a [[wavefront]] that passes at $c$, and so passes through $A$ in time $dt$ which gives $${1 \over A}{dp \over dt} = {S \over c}={EB \over \mu c} \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \text{(flow rate of electromagnetic momentum)}$$ and this

#### ... [[phenomenology|phenomenalogically]]
While a [[optical ray|ray of light]] interacts with a [[container]] or other [[surface]], it exerts radiation pressure.

Treating the surface as a [[wave medium boundary]], the [[subatomic particle collisions]] may result in either [[light absorption]] or [[reflection of electromagnetic waves]], depending on the situational characteristics ([[electronic configuration, and ionization]], [[electromagnetic spectrum, frequency of light]]), following from [[Newton's third law of motion]],

So for those two situations, depending on [[reflection of electromagnetic waves]]$$p_\text{rad} = {S_\text{av} \over c} = {I \over c} \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \text{(radiation pressure, wave absorbed)}$$
$$p_\text{rad} = {2S_\text{av} \over c} = {2I \over c} \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \text{(radiation pressure, wave totally reflected)}$$

#Plagiarism On [[earth, atmosphere, water, and wildlife]] due to [[stars|The Sun]], $$p_\text{rad}= {I \over c} \approx {4.7\times 10^{-6} \text{ Pa}}$$
