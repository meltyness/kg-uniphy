An [[atom]] typically has 0 [[net charge]]. By gaining or shedding [[electrons]], an atom becomes ionized. 
Macroscopically this can constitute a [[material phase change]]. In a continuous material like [[semiconductors]] this is this is called [[generation and recombination]]. In [[Chemistry]] this forms one of the primary [[states]] descriptions of individual atoms.

#### ... the [[Pauli exclusion principle]] and the [[periodic table]]
The [[atomic number]] determines the number of [[electrons]], and each of their [[electron energy level]] is #Caution *generally* determined by the [[electron shell level, or orbit]] they occupy (alternatively, $n$). 

The outer-most shell is called the [[valence shell]] for a particular [[atom]]. This determines the kind of [[chemical reaction]] that are permissible between a pair of interacting [[atom]].

##### and #Caution [[electron shell screening]]
In [[sodium]] since $3d, 4s$ are so close together, and a charge of $+e$ is seen by an [[incident]] [[electrons]], for a single electron differential, $$E_n=-{Z_\text{eff}^2 \over n^2}(13.6 \text{ eV})$$
similar to [[self-energy]], conceptually.

#### ... the Ground State and [[light emission]]
This is the lowest energy level of the [[electrons]] of an [[atom]], and can be measured by the associated [[emission spectra, absorption spectra and diffraction grating, spectroscopy]].

#### ... the Excited State and [[light absorption]]
This is when [[electrons]] have absorbed [[light emission]] and moved.

Such a [[state change]] will always result in or from [[heat radiation and absorption, thermal radiation]], and the [[photon]] [[energy]] can be computed, predicted from the [[tropographic]] 

- [[electron energy level]] associated exclusively with [[electron shell level, or orbit]]
	- [[quantum states]]

These state changes are characterized by 
- [[atom excitation lifetime]] $\approx 1.6 \times 10^{-8} \text { s}$
- [[metastable state]]

In general computing these is a [[computational complexity|hard problem]], and requires [[quantum mechanics]]. 

For [[empirical laws]] see [[Bohr model of the atom]]

#### ... ionization energy, and [[material phase change]]
In order to ionize an atom, an electron must be moved from $n=1$ to $n\rightarrow \infty$, and this can be computed from the energy of the ground state of the
