Simply, [[the magnetic force on a charge in motion is exerted by the magnetic field created by other charged, moving bodies]]

#### ... [[Biot-Savart law]]
Charged bodies in motion obey this [[inverse square law]], this law describes their [[magnetic field]]. 

#### ... [[permanent magnet, ferromagnetic material]]
The discovery of the magnetic force is owed primarily to [[material system]] exhibiting this behavior.

#### ... [[magnetic field]], [[magnetic field lines]]
Provide descriptions, as well as [[Ã˜rsted-Laplace-Thomson law]]

#### ... [[Gauss's law for Magnetism]]
Illustrates limitations of the [[magnetic field]].

#### ... [[Ampere's law]]
That the [[magnetic flux]] is proportional to the [[electrical current]].
