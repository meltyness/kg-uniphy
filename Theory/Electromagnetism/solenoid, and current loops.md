#C27-7 

A [[build, or part]] that can produce a [[magnetic field]] under [[human control]]. It can also act as a [[electrical wire, or terminal]] to close [[electrical terminals]] as a [[logical]] [[switch]] via [[kinematics of rotational motion of rigid bodies|rotation]].

Following from the [[superposition of forces]] for the [[torque]], this [[helix]] comprised of multiple [[magnetic dipole]] this feels in a uniform magnetic field, $\vec{B}$$$\tau = NIAB\sin\phi$$ for its $N$ turns, or windings around a rod.

[[analogy]] to a [[magnetic compass]] or [[permanent magnet, ferromagnetic material]].

Each turn must be [[electrical conductivity, and resistivity|insulated]] as with [[magnet wire, enamelled wire]]

#### ... with a [[permanent magnet, ferromagnetic material|ferromagnetic]] core
When producing a specified [[self inductance, and inductors|self inductance]] in a solenoid we concentrate the [[magnetic flux]] in a region with [[permeability]] which relates to [[relative permeability]] in [[magnetic properties of materials#in permanent magnet ferromagnetic material ferromagnetism|a ferromagnetic material]] with $\mu = K_\text{m}\mu_0$, and so [[Ampere's law]] gives a linear increase in the field strength.

#### ... a [[solenoid, and current loops]] in terms of the [[magnetic dipole]]
Noticing that on the axis of a [[solenoid, and current loops|current loop]], $$B={\mu_0Ia^2 \over 2(x^2+a^2)^{3/2}}$$ notice that we can write this in terms of a [[magnetic dipole]], $\mu=IA$ with $A=\pi a^2$, $$B={\mu_0 \mu \over 2\pi(x^2+a^2)^{3/2}}$$
[[combining two of this construct]] is called a [[Helmholtz coil]]

#### ... and [[mutual inductance]]
A coil with a time-varying current, $i(t)$ places an [[electromotive force, and ideal voltage source|emf]] on another, based on [[Faraday's law of induction]].

#### ... and [[self inductance, and inductors]]
Each loop of a coil with a time-varying current, $i(t)$ places an [[electromotive force, and ideal voltage source|emf]] on the following, based on [[Faraday's law of induction]].
