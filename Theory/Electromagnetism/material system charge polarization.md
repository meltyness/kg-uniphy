#C21-2 

When a [[material system]] with free [[electric charge]] is exposed to an [[electric field]], those [[electric charge freedom|free charges]] align within the material to counter the field. This is the principle for [[electrostatic induction]], [[dielectric, and dielectric strength]], and various systems.

#### ... in terms of [[molecular motion]]
Due to the [[random motion]] of [[molecule]] in a [[material system|substance]] whose [[elementary entities]] have a [[dipole moment]], typically they do not align -- the contribution of their motion due to [[temperature]] is greater than the forces which would cause alignment, and obviously since non-polar molecules don't generally interact electrically in this way, there's no such opportunity for alignment to happen.

With the introduction of an [[electric field]] to a [[gas]] or [[fluid]], the molecules tend to become aligned, except for thermal agitation, and [[random motion]], including nonpolar molecules which can become polarized, an [[induced dipole moment]].

The [[net charge]] on the [[molecule]] of the substance are called [[electric charge freedom|bounded]].
