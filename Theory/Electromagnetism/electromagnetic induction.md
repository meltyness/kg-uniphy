#C29-1
Used in an [[alternator]], [[electrical transformers]], to present [[electromotive force, and ideal voltage source|electromotive force]] via time-varying [[magnetic field]].

It is observed that with a [[ammeter]] across a [[solenoid, and current loops]], the following acts induce a [[electrical current|current]]:
	- Moving a [[permanent magnet, ferromagnetic material]] 
	- Moving another solenoid carrying a current
	- Another solenoid stationary, but with a time-varying current say as an [[AC circuits]] or by disconnecting and reconnecting the [[electrical wire, or terminal]].

Each of these tasks cause the [[magnetic field]] in the stationary solenoid to change, and we call the result an [[electromotive force, and ideal voltage source]].

#### ... through [[Faraday's law of induction]], and [[Lenz's law]]
The name of the relationship between flux and emf.

#### ... as motional [[electromotive force, and ideal voltage source|emf]]
In a [[slidewire generator]] a rod with length $L$, moving with constant $v$ reaches equilibrium when: $$qE=qvB \implies E=vB$$ and so across its length, $$V_\text{ab}=EL=vBL=\mathcal{E}$$
and in-general, $$\mathcal{E}=\oint(\vec{v}\times\vec{B})\cdot d\vec{l}$$

- [[alternator]]
