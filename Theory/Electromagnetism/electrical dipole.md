#C21-7

This is when a pair of [[net charge]] are separated by a [[displacement]], and describes [[molecule]] and can be used to predict motion.

In describing a molecule as having a dipole moment we are [[approximating specific complications]] by treating the molecule as only two regions of [[electric charge]].

#### [[torque]] due to a uniform field
In a uniform [[electric field]] where the dipole has two charges, $q$ separated by $d$ [[formula|we have]]$$\tau = (qE)(d\sin\phi)=\vec{p}\times\vec{E}$$
and we write that the [[dipole moment]] is $$p=qd \ \ \ \ \vec{p}=q\vec{d}$$
#### [[potential energy]] due to a uniform field
The [[derivation]] is as follows, due to [[torque and work, power, energy]] we have $$dW = \tau d\phi \implies W=\int_{\phi_1}^{\phi_2}(-pE\sin\phi)d\phi=pE\cos\phi_1 - pE\cos\phi_2$$
following from the [[potential energy#formula|definition of potential energy]], in terms of work done by an [[externality|external]] force, then a suitable way to write the potential energy is $$U(\phi)=-pE\cos\phi=-\vec{p}\cdot\vec{E}$$
