#C20-1 

When the [[material system]] with [[electric charge]] is [[at rest]], the [[electric field]] primarily obeys [[Coulomb's law]].

#### ... [[law of electric attraction and repulsion]]
Like charges, and unlike charges

#### ... [[electrical conductivity, and resistivity]], [[dielectric, and dielectric strength]]
Describes how a [[material system]] accepts or rejects charge

#### ... charging by [[electrostatic induction]]
This is when a [[material system]] is brought into [[material system charge polarization]] and then has the excess [[electrons]] drained via a [[electrical conductivity, and resistivity]] to [[ground]].

#### ... [[electrical dipole]]
This is when net opposing charges are separated.
