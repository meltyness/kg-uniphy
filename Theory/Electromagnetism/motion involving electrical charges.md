#C21-4 

A [[material system]] with a [[net charge]] will interact through the [[electromagnetic interaction]] and will have a resultant [[kinematics in space]].

A key concern is the [[superposition of fields]].

#### ... [[electrical current]] and [[electrical conductivity, and resistivity]]
This is when a [[charge density]] undergoes [[random motion]].

#### ... [[complete electrical circuit]]
This is another configuration.

#### ... [[electrical energy storage, generation, and transmission]]
The fundamental use of electrical circuits.

#### ... [[motion of charges in a magnetic field]]
For example, torque on a current loop, particle accelerators, voltage dividers, and mass spectrometers.

#### ... at [[relativity]] energy levels
One concern is the production of [[ÄŒernekov radiation]]

#### Applications
- [[nerve cells]]
- [[CD Player]]
- [[incandescent light bulbs]]
- [[electronic devices]]
- [[communications]], [[communications antenna]]
