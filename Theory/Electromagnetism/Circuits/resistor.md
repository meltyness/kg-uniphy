#C25-3

A [[electrical circuit element]] to provide [[human control]] of the [[current]], through a [[circuit branch]] in an [[complete electrical circuit]].

Since it is related to [[electrical conductivity, and resistivity]] and construction of the material, 
$$R(T) = R_0[1+\alpha(T-T_0)]$$
and assuming that through the [[temperature]] range under consideration in this [[simply fit a relationship|linear fit]], that [[thermal expansion]] is not a significant impact to $L, A$ in the construction of the material, $\alpha$ here is the same as the $\alpha$ for $\rho(T)$.

An implementation of a [[human control|variable]] resistor is called a [[potentiometer]].

#### ... equivalent resistance [[formula]]
[[in series]],
$$R_\text{eq} = R_1+R_2+R_3+\dots$$
[[in parallel]], $${1 \over R_\text{eq}} = {1 \over R_1} + {1 \over R_2} + {1 \over R_3} \dots $$


#### Maximum [[electrical power dissipation]]
This is a rating for the [[reliability engineering|operating margins]] of the device
