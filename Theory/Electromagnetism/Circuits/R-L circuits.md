Using the fact that an [[self inductance, and inductors|inductor]] will have a [[voltage, or electric potential|voltage]] $$v = L{di \over dt}$$ across its [[electrical terminals]].

#### ... initial [[states]] [[formula]]
Initially, the switch is closed and the circuit complete connecting the [[resistor]], [[electromotive force, and ideal voltage source|voltage source]], and the maximal change in current is observed across the inductor (but $i=0$, initially)$${\bigg ({di \over dt}\bigg)}_\text{initial}={\mathcal{E} \over L}$$ we also derive a [[time constant]] $$\tau = {L \over R}$$
The other useful statement is $$i(t) = {\mathcal{E} \over R}(1-e^{-(R/L)t})$$
#### ... discharging
Solving the differential equations again gives $$i=I_0e^{-(R/L)t}$$
