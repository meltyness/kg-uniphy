#C30-5

This type of circuit results in [[electrical oscillation]], an [[AC circuits]].

Qualitatively after the [[electromotive force, and ideal voltage source|emf]] is removed, the [[ideal capacitor]], and [[self inductance, and inductors]] exchange their [[energy]] indefinitely.

#### ... [[formula]]
The equation from applying [[Kirchoff's rules]] leads to $${d^2q \over dt^2}+{1 \over LC}q = 0$$ which has the same form as [[simple harmonic motion]].

[[capacitor-spring analogy]] applies here as well. 
Bottom line:
$$\omega = \sqrt{1 \over LC}$$
$$i = -\omega Q\sin(\omega t + \phi)$$
