#C31-1 

A [[electromotive force, and ideal voltage source|source of emf]] which produces time-varying current for example an [[alternator]], or [[solenoid, and current loops]] [[kinematics of rotational motion of rigid bodies|rotating]] in a [[magnetic field]] of a [[permanent magnet, ferromagnetic material]].

A [[Wien-Bridge Oscillator]] is also of interest, presumably.
