#C30-6

This is similar to [[R-C circuits]], [[simple harmonic motion]], but due to the [[electrical power dissipation]] in the [[resistor]] it results in [[dampened oscillation]], or with a time-varying source, [[forced oscillation]], and in-general are [[AC circuits]]. This can be explored via [[analogy]].

#### ... analysis, and [[formula]]
#C31-3
Following from [[phasor]] analysis, the [[reactance]] is like$$Z=\sqrt{R^2+(X_L-X_C)^2}$$
