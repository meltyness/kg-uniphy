#C31-2 

A type of [[task]]-specific [[build, or part|part]] in [[AC circuits]]. A [[machine]] to provide [[human control]] of the [[resonance]] [[frequency]] [[energy]] in the [[complete electrical circuit]]. 

In an L-R-C circuit one can implement [[human control]] of the [[resonance]].

The process is called tuning in [[communications]], and was accomplished with a [[parallel plate capacitor]] with a variable distance, a bit like [[full-scale deflection]].

#### .... basic [[derivation]] and [[formula]] of [[resonance]], and [[harmonic analysis]]
The resonance in an [[L-R-C series circuits]] is the value of $\omega$, $\omega_0$ that minimizes the [[impedance]], and the [[reactance]]. $$Z = \sqrt{R + (X_L - X_C)^2}$$
so this is given simply $$X_L=X_C \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \omega_0L = {1 \over \omega_0C} \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \omega_0={1 \over \sqrt{LC}}$$
graphed, a lower [[resistor]] value results in "sharper" peak of resonance, and a higher resistance results in a more "diffuse" treatment of currents of different frequencies. 

- [[high-pass filter]], as with a [[ideal capacitor]]
- [[low-pass filter]], as with [[self inductance, and inductors]].
