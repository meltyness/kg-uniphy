#C21-1 

For steady [[electrical current]] to be present, a circuit must be **complete** that is a [[path]] must be established preventing any accumulation of charges due to the [[electric field]].

Otherwise the field simply causes [[material system charge polarization]], quickly as a short current [[wave pulse]] (this effect is used to perform [[time-domain reflectometry]])

The [[electrical conductivity, and resistivity]] of the circuit drops the [[potential energy]] of the [[elementary entities]] participating in the current flow, so an [[electromotive force, and ideal voltage source]] must be there to return the incoming [[current density]] to the high [[voltage, or electric potential]].

#### Modeling
With networks of 
- [[ideal capacitor]]
- [[electrical wire, or terminal]]
- [[resistor]]
- [[electromotive force, and ideal voltage source]]
- [[electrical current]]
- any other [[electrical circuit element]]

We write that the voltage drops across each element based on the operating law, (such as [[Ohm's law]] or other [[current-voltage relationship]]), and crucially, application of [[Kirchoff's rules]], or on occasion [[Maxwell's laws]] for certain kinds of situations (consider especially along the $d\vec{l}$-formed equations such as [[Ampere's law]], [[Faraday's law of induction]]) 

#### ... [[electrical potential energy]] and [[power]], [[electrical power dissipation]]
These all happen in for each [[electrical circuit element]]

#### ... [[DC circuits]] / [[AC circuits]]
Depending on power delivery, signal passing,

#### ... [[R-C circuits]], [[R-L circuits]], [[L-C circuits]], [[L-R-C series circuits]]
Time varying devices with terribly interesting applications and analytical techniques which mostly aren't covered here.
