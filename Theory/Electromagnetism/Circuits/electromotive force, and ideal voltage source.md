Represented by, $$\mathcal{E}$$
this is just a [[voltage, or electric potential]], but the extra [[abstract negligible facets|abstraction]] helps clarify discussion of the [[electrical properties of materials]].

- [[batteries]], 
- [[electrical power supplies]],
- [[Van de Graaff generator]],
- [[alternator]]

They do so by [[energy transformation and heat flow]] into [[electrical potential energy]], and then an [[electrical wire, or terminal]] provides the emf to the circuit. The emf is a [[electrical circuit element]].

#### ... [[formula]] for the internal [[resistor|resistance]] model
One way to model this is by [[break down the kinds of behavior into a well-characterized component|breaking down the kinds of behavior into a well-characterized component]], such as a resistor, where $V_\text{ab}$ is the usable voltage, and (varying with [[electrical current]] draw),

$r$ characterizes the loss as a [[resistor]] for the [[electrical power dissipation]] that occurs, $$V_\text{ab} = \mathcal{E} - Ir$$
#### ... [[electric motor#power dissipation in a motor|back emf]]
Back emf is the product of [[motion involving electrical charges]], such as in an [[alternator]], so 

- if the [[rotor]] has a great deal of [[total mechanical energy]] 
- if a great deal of [[voltage, or electric potential]] is supplied while it is still acting as a short

the power goes into the internal resistance, creating heat and risk of [[releasing the magic smoke]].
