#C29-2 

A type of [[AC circuits]] as well as a [[electrical circuit element]] which approximates a [[DC circuits]] by eliminating [[polarity]] change, with a 

- [[diode]]
- [[alternator]]

Also [[analogy|analogous]] to the [[wave medium boundary|fixed wave medium boundary]].

Combined with a [[d'Arsonval galvanometer]], these form the sole [[measurement device]] for the [[phasor]] of [[physical quantities]] involved in [[AC circuits]].
