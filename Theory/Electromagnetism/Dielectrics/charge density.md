Over a [[material system]] broken up into [[test volume]], we have an [[electric charge]] [[density]] is distributed with one of the [[physical quantities]], $$\lambda \propto \bigg\{ {\text{C} \over \text{m}}\bigg\} \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \sigma \propto \bigg\{ {\text{C} \over \text{m}^2}\bigg\}\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \rho \propto \bigg\{ {\text{C} \over \text{m}^3}\bigg\}$$
