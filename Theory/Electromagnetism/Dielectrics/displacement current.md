#C29-7

Since a [[fictitious current]] through a [[parallel plate capacitor]] as predicted by [[Ampere's law]] should also theoretically produce a [[magnetic field]] based on a complete application of the law, with $i_C = i_D$, and a circular area outside the flow between the plates, we predict that the magnetic field should have:  $$\oint \vec{B}\cdot d\vec{l} = B(2\pi r) = \mu_0{r^2 \over R^2}i_C$$ $$\implies B = {\mu_0 \over 2 \pi}{r \over R^2}i_C$$
and the effect was discovered by [[James Clerk Maxwell]]
