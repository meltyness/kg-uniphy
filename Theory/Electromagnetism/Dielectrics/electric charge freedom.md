#C24-5

The property of a set of [[elementary entities]] within a [[material system]] the set of [[electric charge]] that can contribute to:

As an [[abstract negligible facets|abstraction]] this is a bit like [[isolated system]].

#### Free charge
- [[material system charge polarization]], within a [[electrical conductivity, and resistivity#Conductivity in electrostatic interactions|conductor]]
- [[electronic configuration, and ionization]]

#### Bound charge
- [[material system charge polarization]] 
	- within the [[electrical dipole]] of [[molecule]] in a [[dielectric, and dielectric strength]]
- [[intermolecular and interatomic forces]]
- [[subatomic particle collisions]]
	- This is really an event that causes a kind of binding of energy
	- This mode of binding is [[frozen out]] in a [[superconductor]]

#### ... and intermediarily,
- [[mean free time]]
- [[mean free path]]

#### ... and [[how much on average|statistically,]]
- [[Maxwell-Boltzmann Distribution]]

#### ... and in [[quantum kinematics]]
- This is called a [[stationary state]] since [[wavefunction]] $\psi(x,y,z)$ is not a [[function]] of $t$
