In case of a [[ideal capacitor]] separated by [[vacuum]] we have the following derivation. 

#### ... [[derivation]] and [[formula]]
With the [[electric field]] of parallel plates, having accumulated $Q$. $$E={\sigma \over \epsilon_0} = {Q \over \epsilon_0A}$$
and computing the [[voltage, or electric potential]], $$V = Ed = {1 \over \epsilon_0}{Qd \over A}$$
therefore rearranging we arrive at $$C = {Q \over V_\text{ab}}=\epsilon_0{A \over d}$$
Where $\epsilon_0$ is the [[permittivity of free space]]. In terms of [[range of validity]] this has that even transitioning from vacuum to [[air]], accurate to $C \pm 0.06\%$.

#### ... [[derivation]] of the [[pressure]]
#C24-E exercise 24.29 provides a guided proof.

By varying $d=x$ in the capacitor by $dx$ we find the [[potential energy]] in the cap is$$dU = {1 \over 2 \epsilon_0}{Q^2 \over A}dx$$
Since the act of varying energy implies mechanical [[work]], $$dW = F\ dx$$
Then we can write
$$p={F \over A}={1 \over 2 \epsilon_0}{Q^2 \over A^2}$$
