#C24-1

A [[machine]] and [[electrical circuit element]] consisting of two [[electrical conductivity, and resistivity]] separated from one another by a material with [[dielectric, and dielectric strength]] has capacitance, exceeding this results in [[capacitive breakdown]].

The [[dielectric, and dielectric strength]] material becomes [[material system charge polarization|polarized]] and as a result the [[electric field]] stores [[electrical potential energy]], a [[phenomena of nature]] that has reach to describe the nature of [[electromagnetic waves and light]].

Additionally consider that the [[attraction]] between the plates may result in [[pressure]] being applied if a solid [[dielectric, and dielectric strength|dielectric]] is used.

It is also important to consider varying the different parameters of the design of capacitors, this can be performed with the [[form an isotropic measurement]], [[form an isostable measurement]], and any other [[tropographic]] problem solving techniques.

#### ... [[derivation]] and [[formula]]
A [[voltage, or electric potential]] $V_\text{ab}$ is placed across the capacitor, and a charge $Q, -Q$ is accumulates on the plates, and the capacitor is charged, it holds $V_\text{ab}$ even after the supply is removed.

The [[electric field]] is proportional to $Q$, this defines capacitance, $$C= {Q \over V_\text{ab}}$$
With [[SI units]] of the [[farad]]. 

Capacitance is a measure of the ability of the capacitor for [[energy storage and transmission]].

#### ... for a [[parallel plate capacitor]]
The simple case where the dielectric is [[vacuum]]

#### ... in an [[complete electrical circuit]], and [[R-C circuits]]
In an electrical circuit we can create across two [[electrical terminals]] equivalent capacitances with the following relationships:

For capacitors [[in series]], [[in a series connection the magnitude of charge on all plates is the same]]
$$ {1 \over C_\text{eq}} = {1 \over C_1} + {1 \over C_2} + {1 \over C_3} \dots$$
and [[in parallel]], [[in a parallel connection the magnitude of the voltage on all plates is the same]]$$C_\text{eq} = C_1 + C_2 + C_3 \dots$$
#### ... as a method of [[energy storage and transmission]]
In order to find the amount of energy in a charged capacitor we apply [[law of conservation of energy]], and [[describe any facet of the assembly process|describe the process of charging]] it through [[voltage, or electric potential]]. In order to charge a capacitor to its maximum $C=Q/V$ we'll go through intermediate stages at $C = q/v \implies dW = v \ dq = {q \ dq / C}$ $$W = \int_0^W dW ={1 \over C} \int_0^Q q \ dq = {Q^2 \over 2C}$$
which can be rewritten $$U = {Q^2 \over 2C} = \frac{1}{2}CV^2=\frac{1}{2}QV$$
$$u = {U \over {Ad}} \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \text{(in a parallel plate cap)}$$
This also forms a concept of [[energy density]]

#### ... in terms of [[displacement current]]
See [[Ampere's law#for displacement current and electromagnetic induction|generalization to Ampere's law]], to deconflict whether or not an [[ideal capacitor]] is a logical contradiction to the [[complete electrical circuit]].
