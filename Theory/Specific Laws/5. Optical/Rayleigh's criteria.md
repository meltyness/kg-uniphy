#C36-7

In terms of the [[pinhole camera, and Airy disk]], [[distinction, and indistinguishability|distinguishability]] occurs when one disk passes through the center of another. The angular radius outside the point for a diameter $D$ disk and [[incident]] [[electromagnetic spectrum, frequency of light|wavelength]]$$\sin\theta_1 = 1.22{\lambda \over D}$$
forms a [[speed limit]] on resolving of a [[point object]].
