#C33-2 

A form of [[transmission]], where a specific [[kind of material]], with an [[index of refraction]], and due to the [[optical surface properties of materials]] $$n={c \over v}$$An [[optical ray]] of a single [[electromagnetic spectrum, frequency of light|light frequency]] is incident, to the [[material surface normal]] of a [[material system]], with an angle $\theta_a$ off the [[material surface normal]], and so at the [[material smooth surface]] [[thermal contact, material system junction, optical junction or adventure|junction]], when the light is refracted, gives [[formula]] $$n_a\sin\theta_a=n_b\sin\theta_b$$
This is called Snell's law, described by [[Willebrord Snell]].

As an additional note, [[refraction always places the refracted ray on the opposite side of the normal as the incident ray]].
