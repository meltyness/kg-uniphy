#C33-2 

In this case, an [[optical ray]] is incident, [[material surface normal]] of a [[material system]], with an angle $\theta_a$ off the [[material surface normal]].

The [[incident]], [[reflection]] and [[material surface normal]] are all [[coplanar]]

The reflection angle is equal to the attack angle gives [[formula]] $$\theta_a = \theta_r$$ it is also important to note that this [[task]] has [[reversibility]] -- the path in is the path out.

#### ... effect on [[light intensity]]
[[light intensity]] under [[reflection|reflection]] varies with 
- [[incident]] angle 
	- it is a minimum at the [[material surface normal]], 
	- it also varies sharply with the [[law of total internal reflection]] #WaitWhat #ConstructorTheory  [[photonic computing|let's use this variance with angle for statistical computation]]?
- The two material's [[index of refraction]] [[Brewster's law]]
	- #WaitWhat is this a ratio? difference? some other relationship?
- [[electromagnetic wave polarization]]
