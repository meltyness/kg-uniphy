#20thCentury the [[Michelson-Morley experiment]] posed a [[disaster]] for a prevailing theory about the [[the motion of light, and light propagation]].

> The [[speed of light]] in a [[vacuum]] is the same in all [[inertial frame of reference]], and is independent of the [[motion]] of the [[material system]] [[what causes motion, or causality|which caused]] [[electromagnetic waves and light|the disturbance]].

From this follows that
- [[it is impossible for an inertial observer to travel at the speed of light in vacuum]]
- The [[relative velocity]] cannot be simple addition.
