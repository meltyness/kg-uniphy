In the [[the motion of light, and light propagation]], we describe the following: 

> Folowing from [[Maxwell's laws]] both reflection and refraction can occur simultaenously, consider that [[glass]] is a [[dielectric, and dielectric strength|dielectric]], and under small, fast variations in [[electric charge]], an [[ideal capacitor]] is a [[high-pass filter]] which should support some charge motion and the production of a reflection.

And we have the [[formula]], ( where the [[optical ray]] is [[incident]] with the [[material surface normal]])$$E_r={{n_a - n_b} \over {n_a+n_b}}E_i$$
Other effects, and the distance of the medium can lead to a non-trivial phase shift.


This might be a limiting case of [[the optical ray parameters at a junction are coplanar]]
