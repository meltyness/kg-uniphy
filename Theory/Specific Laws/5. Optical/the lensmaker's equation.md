#C34-4 

Provides a relationship between [[focal point, and focal length]], [[index of refraction]], [[optical radius]] and through the [[sign rules of geometric optics|sign rules]] the orientation of the [[center of curvature]] of each [[thermal contact, material system junction, optical junction or adventure|junction]]. 

#### [[formula]] [[derivation]]
- Establish a pair of [[thermal contact, material system junction, optical junction or adventure|junctions]], $J_1,J_2$ and three refraction indices, $n_a,n_b,n_c$ 
- Establish an [[extended object]], the sole source of [[optical ray]] 
- Considering $J_1$ operating, we have 
	- [[object distance]] $s_1$ and [[image distance]] $s_1'$ both postive.
- Recalling that [[principle of image transitivity]] may exist, we consider $J_2$ operating on the image produced by $J_1$
	- In this case $s_2$ is a distance $s_1$ from the lens, but it is on the opposite side of the [[optical ray]] as the incident rays, and by the [[sign rules of geometric optics]], this implies $s_2 < 0$ and since it is now the object we take $s_2 = -s_1'$.
- We write the [[derivation of a spherical and planar refractive lens|single-surface relation]] twice,
- $${(n_b-n_a) \over R} = {n_a \over s_1} + {n_b \over s_1'} \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ {(n_c-n_b) \over R} = {n_b \over s_2} + {n_c \over s_2'}$$
- Setting $n_a = n_c = 1$ for the [[vacuum]] approximation, we can perform simple rewrites to arrive at  the following [[formula]] for the [[object-image relationship]], for light from $s$ incident onto $R_1$,
$${1 \over s} + {1 \over s'} = (n-1)\bigg({1 \over R_1} - {1 \over R_2}\bigg)$$
- and for the [[focal point, and focal length]], the lensmaker's equation, $${1 \over f} = (n-1)\bigg({1 \over R_1} - {1 \over R_2}\bigg)$$ Though the construction of such a lens is also subject to [[aberration]].
