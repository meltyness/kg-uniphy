#C34-1
#### ... [[polarity|sign]] rules
For a given [[optical lens]] with a [[center of curvature]], and [[material system]] treated as a collection of [[point object]], [[extended object]].
- The [[object distance]], $s$ is positive only when **the object** is on the same side as the **incoming** [[optical ray]] [[incident]] on the [[thermal contact, material system junction, optical junction or adventure|junction]]
- The [[image distance]], $s'$ is positive when **the image** is on the same side as the **outgoing** [[optical ray]] from the junction.
- The [[optical radius]], $R$ is positive when the [[center of curvature]] $C$ is on the same side as the **outgoing** [[optical ray]] from the junction, 

#Caution these need not always be clear from the model. That is the sign rule for $s'$ may need to be used to determine the location, rather than determining the location before modeling.

Additionally, a $m<0$ lateral [[optical magnification]] corresponds to an image that is [[optically inverted]]
