#C38-7 

A [[quantum mechanics]] effect observed in the [[Rayleigh scattering]] of high [[electromagnetic spectrum, frequency of light]], short [[wavelength]] [[electromagnetic waves and light]] and [[photon]].

#### ... [[formula]] [[derivation]]
- An incident photon has $\vec{p}$ with energy $pc$ following from [[Einstein's special theory of relativity#and law of conservation of energy|relativistic energy conservation]]
	- The scattered photon has $\vec{p}'$ with energy $p'c$
- Take the electron to be at rest, therefore energy $m_ec^2$ 
	- The deflected electron has $\vec{P}_e$ with energy $E_e^2 = (mc^2)^2+(P_ec)^2$
- The total system then has
	- $pc+mc^2=p'c+E_e$
- Finally we solve for $P_e$ by writing $\vec{P}_e=\vec{p}-\vec{p}'$ from [[law of conservation of momentum]], computing the [[there exists a vector dot product for relating two vectors, their angles, and magnitudes|magnitude]] and solving algebraically, therefore 
$$\lambda'-\lambda = {h \over mc}(1-\cos\phi)$$


#### [[phenomenology]]
- By [[analogy]] at a [[optical surface properties of materials|rough surface]], incident light undergoes [[diffuse reflection]].
- Incident light with $\lambda$ undergoes [[scattering]] at an angle $\phi$ ( #Caution scattering is measured from the tangent, rather than the normal, see [[x-ray crystallography]].)
- It is observed that with the [[speed of light]], [[electrons|electron mass]], and [[Planck constant]], the phenomena has [[formula]], $$\lambda' - \lambda = {h \over m_ec}(1-\cos\phi)$$
- The [[explanation]] follows from [[quantum mechanics]] in the following way:
	- The scattering process is a [[subatomic particle collisions]] of
		- 1 [[photon]]
		- 1 [[electrons]]
	- The incident photon vanishes, providing a [[momentum]] to the electron
	- The remaining [[momentum]] is on the newly-[[emission|emitted]] photon.
	- The principle follows by application of [[law of conservation of energy]] from [[Einstein's special theory of relativity#and law of conservation of energy|relativistic energy conservation]] which takes into account [[mass-energy equivalence]]
- There are also [[population]] effects to consider for the case where the photon acts on the energy of an [[atom]] or [[molecule]] rather than on a single [[electrons]], which effects the [[resonance]] of the scattered light.
