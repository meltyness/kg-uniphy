#### ... [[phenomenology]] of [[polarization of optical rays]] by [[law of specular reflection|specular reflection]]
- An [[optical ray]] is [[incident]] to a [[thermal contact, material system junction, optical junction or adventure|junction]], and all the optical properties / [[angle|angles]] are [[the optical ray parameters at a junction are coplanar|coplanar]].
- The perpendicular components are reflected more strongly, following from [[reflection of electromagnetic waves#as law of specular reflection|certain properties of reflection]].
- This results in [[polarization of optical rays|partial polarization of light rays]].
- There exists a [[thermal contact, material system junction, optical junction or adventure|junction]] [[polarization angle]] (like the [[law of total internal reflection|total internal reflection critical angle]])
- When the angle of incidence is $\theta_p$ the light polarized in the plane of incidence is completely refracted, and the perpendicularly-polarized light is completely reflected.
- The reflected ray and the refracted ray are complementary ($90^\circ$ to one another) and so $\theta_b = 90^\circ - \theta_p$

So [[derivation|placing these two facets]] into the [[law of light transmission, and refraction]], $$n_a\sin\theta_p = n_b\sin\theta_b$$[[formula|it then follows]] that, $$\tan\theta_p={n_b \over n_a}$$
Additionally this can be found from [[Maxwell's laws]].
