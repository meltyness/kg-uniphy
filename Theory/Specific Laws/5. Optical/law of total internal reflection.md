#C33-3

At an extreme [[incident]] [[angle]] to the [[material surface normal]] at a [[thermal contact, material system junction, optical junction or adventure|junction]], [[law of light transmission, and refraction]] collapses to produce this effect.

Note that this effect outperforms metallic reflection and results in [[breakthrough|theoretically 100% reflection]]. #WaitWhat 

#### ... [[formula]] [[derivation]]
With $a$ being the attack angle, and $b$ being the transmitted angle, following from $$n_a\sin\theta_a = n_b\sin\theta_b$$
and supposing there exists some angle (i.e., $n_a > n_b$) where the refracted angle  $\theta_b = 90^\circ$ off normal so $$\sin\theta_b = 1$$
[[establishing a critical value at which the behavior of a physical phenomena abruptly changes|then the critical angle of attack]] is $\theta_\text{critical}$ $$\sin\theta_\text{critical} = {n_b \over n_a}$$
