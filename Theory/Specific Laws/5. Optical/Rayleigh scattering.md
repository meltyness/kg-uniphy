#C33-6
Light incident onto a [[thermal contact, material system junction, optical junction or adventure|junction]] with [[optical surface properties of materials]] that it [[scattering|scatters]] light, the [[material system]] acts like a [[molecular motion]] [[communications antenna|antenna]], similar to [[electrical current#variable situations|electrical current with ions]] as the [[elementary entities|elementary entities / charge carriers]].

This effect is most pronounced, and results in strong [[polarization of optical rays|polarization]] on indirect [[illumination]] from a skew source, such as overhead light from [[stars|the sun]] scattering off of the [[atmosphere]] in the later afternoon will be strongly polarized.

The material [[law of light transmission, and refraction|engages in light transmission]] via [[heat radiation and absorption, thermal radiation]].

Characteristically, there is a fall off with $x^4$ (is a useful [[analogy]] to [[viscosity]] [[fluid flow]]?)

#### [[earth, atmosphere, water, and wildlife]]
- [[water]] as a [[gas]] in the [[atmosphere]] exhibits scattering.
- In the atmosphere, the [[degrees of freedom]] of [[intramolecular motion]] is such that theh [[electromagnetic spectrum, frequency of light]] emitted is blue.
- This explains why the sky is blue
