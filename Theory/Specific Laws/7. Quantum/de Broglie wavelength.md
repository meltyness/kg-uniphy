The [[wavelength]] of a [[subatomic particle]] is [[derivation|derived]] from its [[momentum]] the following to give [[formula]],
- A [[subatomic particle]] with [[rest mass]], $m_0$ (recall we may need to account for [[Einstein's special theory of relativity|relativistic mass]])$$\lambda = {h \over p} = {h \over mv}$$
- Which would also imply that $E=hf$, as with the [[photon]], typically on order [[electron volt]].

#### Applications
