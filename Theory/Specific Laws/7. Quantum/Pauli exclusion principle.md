In the [[central-field approximation]], 

> No two [[electrons]] in an [[atom]] can occupy the same [[quantum states|state]] $(n,l,m_l,m_s)$

This accounts for the [[atomic group]] diversity and [[chemical reaction]] observed in the [[periodic table]] and the associated [[electronic configuration, and ionization]].
