#KeyConcept 

##### Claim
Stated formally,
[[Newton's first law of motion#Known Caveats|When observed from an intertial frame]], a [[rigid body|body]] acted on by no [[superposition of forces|net force]] exhibits:
- with constant (possibly zero) [[velocity]], 
- and zero [[acceleration]].

Also known as "the law of inertia."

##### Terminology
It is in this context there's [[inertia]], the propensity of motion to remain constant.

Additionally, it is under the first law we have [[equilibrium]], the [[thermodynamic state|states]] where the net force is $\vec{0}$, and the body has constant [[velocity]] (no change in [[speed]] or [[direction]]) eg. for a given body, we have the [[formula]] $$\sum{\vec{F_i}} = \vec{0} \implies \vec{v}=\vec{c}$$
##### Known Caveats
This law is only followed for observers in an [[inertia#Extending validity to other frames|inertial frame]] -- that is the observer and the body under consideration must have a constant [[relative velocity]]. #WaitWhat about constant relative speed? #GotIt this is called the [[coriolis effect]], see also [[fictitious force]].

[[earth, atmosphere, water, and wildlife]]'s surface, at a specific [[latitude and longitude]] in this context, is considered an approximately [[inertial frame of reference]].
