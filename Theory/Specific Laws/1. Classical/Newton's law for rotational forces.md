#### [[Newton's second law of motion]] applied to [[torque|rotational forces]]
In the language of torque we have [[derivation|the relation]] (which can be derived from NSL, [[kinematics of rotational motion of rigid bodies#Kinematics|rotational kinematics]] $$a_\text{tan}=r\alpha$$, which per [[particle]] on the surface gives the [[formula]] $$m_ir_i^2\alpha$$ recalling as well that [[at any instant, every part of a rotating rigid body has the same angular velocity]] 

and from our definition of [[moment of inertia]] $$I = m_ir_i^2$$Finally,
$$\sum \tau = I \alpha$$
