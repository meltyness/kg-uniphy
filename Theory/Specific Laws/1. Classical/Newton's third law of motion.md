##### Claim
Stated formally,
If [[rigid body]] $A$ acts on $B$ (an "[[action]]") then body $B$ reacts to $A$ (a "reaction"), with the same magnitude and in the opposite direction. The two forces described act on different bodies.

##### Terminology
The forces onto $A$ and $B$ are called an [[action-reaction pair]]

[[formula|Symbolically]], $$\vec{F}_{\text{A on B}} = -\vec{F}_{\text{B on A}}$$
##### Known Caveats
This also applies to any [[long-range force]] as well as the intuition one could have that it applies to any [[contact force]].

The two forces in an [[action-reaction pair]] **never** act on the same body.

It is useful to introduce another [[contact force]], [[tension force]].
