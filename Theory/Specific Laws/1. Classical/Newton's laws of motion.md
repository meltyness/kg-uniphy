### The Laws
#### [[Newton's first law of motion]] ([[glass]] ketchup bottles)
When the [[force#Superposition|net force]] on a body is zero, then its [[motion]] does not change.

#### [[Newton's second law of motion]] (on mars)
Otherwise, the force is related to the [[mass]] and [[acceleration]] of the body.

As well as [[Newton's law for rotational forces]]

#### [[Newton's third law of motion]] (splattering against mustard)
Two interacting bodies can exert a force on one another.

#### [[Newton's law of gravitation]] (everywhere)
All matter interacts.
