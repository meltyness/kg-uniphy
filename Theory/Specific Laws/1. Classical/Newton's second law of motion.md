##### Claim
Stated formally,
When a [[superposition of forces]] is applied to a [[rigid body|body]] it's [[kinematics along a straight line#with Constant Acceleration|velocity varies with constant acceleration]], [[a net force acting on a body causes the body to accelerate in the same direction as the net force|in the direction of the force applied]].

Additionally we [[describe outcomes|observe]] that [[for a given body, the acceleration is directly proportional to the force applied]]

- If a [[externality|external]] acts on a body, the body accelerates.
- The direction of acceleration is the same as the direction of the net force
- The mass of the body times the acceleration of the body equals the net force [[vector quantity|vector]].

##### Terminology
See also [[kinematics along a straight line#with Variable Acceleration|kinematics with variable acceleration]] for dealing with the general case where forces are applied temporarily.

From this we relate: [[newton]], [[kilogram]], and [[meters]] / [[second]] \* second as related units: $$\text{1 newton} = \text{(1 kilogram)(1 meter per second squared)}$$ or $$ 1 \text{N} = 1 \text{kg}\cdot \text{m}/\text{s}^2$$ In this light, [[mass]] seems to quantify [[inertia]]. Since for a given force, more mass implies less acceleration. We can use these principles to construct a [[spring balance]] for the purpose of measuring masses.

Finally Newton's Second Law [[formula|is stated as]], $$\sum \vec{F} = m \vec{a}$$ or explicitly in terms of [[scalar quantity|components]], $$\sum F_x = ma_x \ \ \ \ \ \ \sum F_y = ma_y \ \ \ \ \ \ \sum F_z = ma_z$$

##### Known Caveats
[[It's impossible for a body to affect its own motion by exerting force on itself]], so the net force may only be composed of [[externality|external actions]].

This only holds for constant mass. Use [[momentum]] for dealing with situations like a leaking truck, rocket ship, or railroad being loaded with coal.

Also only valid in an [[inertia#Extending validity to other frames|inertial frame]].
