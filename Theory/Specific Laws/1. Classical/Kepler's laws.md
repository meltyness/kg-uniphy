#C12-5 

A set of [[empirical laws]] discovered by [[Kepler]] for determining the [[motion]] of [[earth, atmosphere, water, and wildlife]], [[planet]], [[stars]]

#### The laws
The laws can be [[derivation|derived]] from [[Newton's law of gravitation]] in the following [[formula|manner]]:
1. [[each planet moves in an elliptical orbit, with the sun at one focus of the ellipse]]
	1. Newton showed that circle, ellipse are the only possible [[closed orbits]], and that parabola and hyperbola the only [[open orbits]] using "a lot more [[differential equations]] than we're ready for."
2. [[a line from the sun to a given planet sweeps out equal areas in equal times]]
	1. The [[sector velocity]] has the following form: $${dA \over dt}=\frac{1}{2}r^2{d\theta \over dt}$$
	2. with $v_\perp=v\sin \phi=rd\theta / dt$ $$=\frac{1}{2}rv\sin\phi$$
	3. And that $\frac{1}{m}rv\sin\phi=\frac{1}{m}|\vec{r}\times \vec{v}|$ $$={L \over 2m} $$
	4. And since $\vec{\tau}=\vec{r}\times\vec{F}=\vec{0}$ for the [[gravitational interaction]], a [[central force]], ${d\vec{L}\over dt}=\vec{0}$
3. [[the periods of the planets are proportional to the 3/2 powers of the major axis lengths of their orbits]]
	1. From the discussion of [[satellite motion]], $$T={2\pi a^{3/2} \over \sqrt{Gm_s}}$$
