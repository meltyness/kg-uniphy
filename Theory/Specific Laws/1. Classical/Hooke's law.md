#### Ideal [[spring]]
Described by [[Robert Hooke]] describes [[force]] exterted by a [[spring]] under [[displacement]]. See the [[spring force]]

#### General Form
With the assertion that:

- [[stress]] characterizes the strength of the force causing a deformation as $\text{N/m}^2$
- [[strain]] describes the resulting [[deformation and elasticity|deformation]]
- and this is mediated by some [[elastic modulus]], such as $k$ in the case presented above or [[Young's modulus]].

$${\text{Stress} \over \text{Strain}} = \text{Elastic modulus}$$

#ConstructorTheory does this relate in any interesting way to [[ideal capacitor]]?
#GotIt [[capacitor-spring analogy]]
#### [[range of validity|Range of validity]]

This should always be considered an [[experiment or measurement|experimental finding]] with a [[range of validity]], described on a per-[[material]] basis, using a [[stress-strain curve]]
