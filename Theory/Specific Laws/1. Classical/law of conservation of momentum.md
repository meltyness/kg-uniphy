#### Discussion
Two interacting bodies are governed by [[Newton's third law of motion]] as an [[action-reaction pair]]. So are the [[impulse]] imparted onto one another. Therefore, the [[momentum]] are equal and opposite.

See also [[law of conservation of angular momentum]].

#### [[formula]]
[[If the vector sum of the external forces on a system is zero, the total momentum of the system is constant]]
$$\vec{P} = \sum{\vec{p}_i} = \vec{0}$$

#### [[derivation]]
Formally for an [[isolated system]] with two [[internal forces]], $$\vec{F}_{\text{B on A}}={d\vec{p}_{\text{A}}\over dt} \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \vec{F}_{\text{A on B}}={d\vec{p}_{\text{B}}\over dt}$$
and $\vec{F}_{\text{B on A}}=-\vec{F}_{\text{A on B}}$ so $${{d(\vec{p}_\text{A} + \vec{p}_\text{B})} \over dt}=\vec{0}$$
Define total momentum of the system: $$\vec{P}=\vec{p}_\text{A} + \vec{p}_\text{B} \implies {d\vec{P}\over dt}=\vec{0}$$ Therefore, the momentum of the closed system doesn't change.
