### Definition
The total amount of [[energy]] stays the same.

Under conservation, no outside energy is introduced into any system, [[potential energy]] is [[energy transformation and heat flow|transformed]] into [[kinetic energy]], and vice versa.

This also relates to [mathematical conservation](obsidian://open?vault=Calculus%20Review&file=Multivariable%20Calculus%2FObjects%2Fconservative%20vector%20field) when the [[force|acting force]] is represented with a general vector field.

Essentially that the [[total mechanical energy]] is conserved.

#### [[formula]]
 We abstract [[total mechanical energy]] in a simple system composed of a body capable of carrying [[mass]], [[speed]], and distance from a [[surface gravity]].

We write that $$K_1 + U_{\text{grav,1}} = K_2 + U_{\text{grav,2}}$$
Assuming that only gravity would be doing work on the body.

[[conservation|A quantity that always has the same value is called conserved]] is how it sounds, in general.

$$\Delta K + \Delta U + \Delta U_{\text{int}} = 0$$

This forms the basis for the [[Lagrangian formulation]]
