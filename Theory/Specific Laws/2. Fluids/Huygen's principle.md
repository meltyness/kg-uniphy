#C33-7

#17thCentury (pronounced Herr-gren's, almost like "Aaron's") [[physical laws and principles|principle]], which follows from [[Maxwell's laws]]. Notice this also applies to analyzing [[mechanical waves]].

> Every point of a [[wavefront]] may be considered the source of secondary [[wavelets]] that spread (#WaitWhat of the same shape?) out in all directions with a speed equal to the [[wave speed]] of the original [[wave]].

Practically speaking this is a physical way to explain the [[potato extension technique]], and [[field#helpful mathematical links|Lagrange multipliers]] (i.e., Gauss's general law follows from this principle). #WaitWhat Can we state this as a [[task]]?

#### ... to demonstrate [[law of specular reflection]]
Consider a [[electromagnetic waves and light#as a plane wave step wave|plane wave]] propagating towards a flat [[mirror]] [[thermal contact, material system junction, optical junction or adventure|junction]] at an angle, $\theta_a$

Finding that an arrival, $A$ will have reflected a distance $vt$ on a subsequent wavefront, and that a further point along will still have a distance $vt$ before being reflected itself. [[exploit the symmetry of a problem]] and establishing [[triangle congruency]] we find that $\theta_a=\theta_r$, and we have a [[derivation]] of reflection from this principle.

#### ... to demonstrate [[law of light transmission, and refraction]]
A similar arrangement using the [[assume common, reasonable system geometry|geometry]] and writing the new wavefront [[tangent]] to $v_at, v_bt$ depending on the [[speed of light]] in that [[material system]], also suffices to demonstrate this #ProofDeferred
