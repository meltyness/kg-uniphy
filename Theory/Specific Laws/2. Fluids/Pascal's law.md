#C14-2

In the scope of dealing with [[bulk stress]]

[[the pressure applied to an enclosed fluid is transmitted undiminished to every portion of the fluid and the walls of the containing vessel]] 

There are a variety of other [[physical laws and principles|laws]] for [[non-newtonian fluids]], and be aware that this law approximates fluids as [[tensile-compressive stress|incompressible]] -- wheras [[gas]] may be compressible, and therefore have variable [[mass density]].

An obvious [[disaster|violation]] can be seen with with the [[mechanical waves]] in [[fluid]] having a [[wave speed]], to illustrate the limitations. 

#### [[derivation]]
With uniform [[mass density]] in a fluid [[at rest]] we have:
$$\sum F_y = 0$$
and [[pressure]] related to [[gravitational potential energy]] of [[surface gravity]] $$pA-(p+dp)A-\rho gA \ dy = 0$$ which leaves $${dp \over dy} = -\rho g$$
re-arrange and [[integral|integrate]],$$p_2-p_1 = -\rho g (y_2-y_1) \ \ \ \ \ \ \text{(pressure in a fluid of uniform density)}$$ and as stated, $$p=p_0 + \rho g h \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \text{(pascal's law)}$$
See that this implies $p_0$ appears [[time|instantly]] everywhere.
