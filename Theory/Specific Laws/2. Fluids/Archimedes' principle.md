#C14-3

[[when a body is completely or partially immersed in a fluid, the fluid exerts an upward force on the body equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the body]]

Note that this may generate a [[torque]] at the [[center of gravity]] of the [[rigid body|object]] being floated. #WaitWhat is it applied at the [[center of gravity]] or [[center of mass]]? #GotIt [[weight]] of the fluid, not [[mass]] of fluid.

Describes [[immersion]]

#### [[formula|Formula]]
So with [[surface gravity]] $g$, a [[fluid]] [[mass density]] $\rho_f$ and an object with [[volume]] $V$ we can easily see that the [[buoyancy|buoyant force]] is $$B=\rho V(-g)$$
#### Applications
- [[hydrometer]]
- [[sphygmomanometer]]
