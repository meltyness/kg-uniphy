#C25-2

An [[analogy]] to the [[ideal gas law]], [[Hooke's law]], models [[electrical conductivity, and resistivity]] as a [[simply fit a relationship|straight line]]. The more general structure is called the [[current-voltage relationship]] and has [[formula]] $$\rho = {E \over J} \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \text{(resistivity)}$$
Which is a [[physical quantities]] with [[SI units]] of the [[ohm]]-[[meters]]. It is a [[]]

#### ... [[range of validity]]
In [[metal]], [[isothermal]],, this is a good approximation.

#### ... [[derivation]] applicable for [[electrical circuit element]] in a [[complete electrical circuit]]
With $$\vec{E} = \rho \vec{J}$$
established, and assuming that through the [[circuit branch]] $\vec{E}, \vec{J}$ are uniform, taking $I=JA, V=EL$, $${V \over L} = \rho {I \over A} \implies$$
$$V = IR$$
and $$R = {\rho L \over A}$$
