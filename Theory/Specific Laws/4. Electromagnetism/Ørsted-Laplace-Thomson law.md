#C27-2
Following from the principles, observations:
- The [[force]] is proportional to the [[electric charge]] being acted on (including the [[polarity]])
- The force is proportional to the velocity of the charge.
- [[The magnetic force is always perpendicular to the field acting and velocity of the reacting]]
	- [[there exists a vector cross product relating three vectors|we can express this with the cross product]], and use the [[right-hand rule]].

Have the [[formula]]
$$\vec{F} = q\vec{v} \times \vec{B}$$
