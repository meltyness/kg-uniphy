#C27-4 

The [[magnetic flux]] version of [[Gauss's law]] [[invert the sense of common questions]], [[establish a test volume or area]], and [[exploit the symmetry of a problem]].

This follows from the principle that [[it's impossible to create a magnetic monopole]], and can be [[formula|expressed symbolically]], (and proven by [[analogy]] following from [[derivation of Gauss's law]]) $$\oint\vec{B}\cdot d\vec{A}=0$$
