[[Gauss's law]] [[invert the sense of common questions]], [[establish a test volume or area]], and [[exploit the symmetry of a problem]].

Rather than trying to find details of the [[electric field]] given details about the [[electric charge]]. 

Instead, we start with details about the [[electric field]] and compute the [[electric flux]] which tells us how much [[electric charge]] there is in an [[test volume]].

Formulated by [[Carl Frederich Gauss]]

#### [[derivation of Gauss's law]]
Applying the fact that [[the flux through a sphere is independent of the radius]], and the [[potato extension technique]] we can conclude that the [[electric field lines can begin or end inside a region of space only when there is charge in that region]]. $$\Phi_E=\oint\vec{E}\cdot d\vec{A}={Q_\text{enclosed} \over \epsilon_0} $$
#### Demonstration of [[electrical properties of materials]]
[[in electrostatics the electric field at every point within the material of a conductor must be zero|The electric field inside of an electrostatic conductor is zero, everywhere]] from this, and by applying Gauss's law, we can [[employ deductive reasoning|conclude]] that any [[net charge]] must have [[in an electrostatic situation, the charge accumulates entirely on the surface of the conductor|accumulated on the surface]]. Note that this does not consider any [[cavitation]] the [[electrical conductivity, and resistivity]] may exhibit.

#### ... very close to the [[surface]] of a [[material system]]
We have that [[the electric field in an electrostatic Just outside of a conductor is always perpendicular]]. Which implies $$E_\perp = {\sigma \over \epsilon_0}$$
and that [[charge on a non-uniform body tends to accumulate more readily in portions with more curvature]]. This principle leaads to [[lightning, and lightning rods]]

#### ... [[Earnshaw's theorem]]
One can speak of [[impossible]] situations, this also implies that
