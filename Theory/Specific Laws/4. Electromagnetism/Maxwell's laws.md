[[synthesizes a very generic, correct statement regarding a number of disparate observations|Collected]], assuming:
- [[electric charge]] and [[electrical current]]
- Present in a [[vacuum]], so that [[permittivity of free space]], [[permeability of free space]] apply.

Combined with [[Lorentz force]], these statements form a complete description of the [[electromagnetic interaction]]

#### [[Gauss's law]] for $\vec{E}$
$$\oint \vec{E}\cdot d\vec{A} = {q \over \epsilon_0}$$
#### [[Gauss's law for Magnetism]] for $\vec{B}$
$$\oint\vec{B}\cdot d\vec{A} = 0$$
#### [[Ampere's law]] for currents
$$\oint\vec{B}\cdot d\vec{l} = \mu_0(i_C + \epsilon_0{d \Phi_E \over dt})_\text{enclosed}$$
#### [[Faraday's law of induction]]
Through a *stationary* closed [[path]]
$$\oint\vec{E}\cdot d\vec{l} = {-d\Phi_B \over dt}$$

#### ... relationship to [[electrodynamic interactions]]
$\vec{E}$ appears in many of these equations, but appears elsewhere in two senses. 
- The [[electrostatic interactions]] sense that it is due to a [[superposition of fields]] of the [[electric field]] due to a  [[net charge]] in [[space]], as in [[Coulomb's law]]
- The [[electrodynamic interactions]] sense that it is due to the presence of a varying [[magnetic field]].

It can be shown that within Maxwell's laws that: $$\vec{E} = \vec{E}_c + \vec{E}_n$$
#### ... [[take cases|taking cases]] when $q_\text{net}=0$,
We can write $$\oint\vec{E}\cdot d\vec{A} = \oint\vec{B}\cdot d\vec{A}$$ and by inserting the definition of [[magnetic flux]], [[electric flux]], Ampere and Faraday's laws become $$\oint\vec{B}\cdot d\vec{l} = \epsilon_0\mu_0{d \over dt}\int\vec{E}\cdot d\vec{A} \ \ \ \ \ \ \text{and} \ \ \ \ \ \  \oint\vec{E}\cdot d\vec{l} = -{d \over dt}\int\vec{B}\cdot d\vec{A}$$ #WaitWhat are the limits of integration here?

These statements are the reason for [[electromagnetic waves and light]], and we conclude that [[light is due to a wavelike disturbance between the electrical and magnetic fields]]

#OpenQuestion [[it's impossible to create a magnetic monopole]]?
