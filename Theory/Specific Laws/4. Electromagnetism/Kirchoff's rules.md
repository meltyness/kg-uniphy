#C26-2
Two simple [[formula]] describe the most common [[complete electrical circuit]] constraints.

#### Kirchoff's Junction rule
The [[electrical current]] into any junction is:
$$\sum I = 0$$
Following from [[principle of conservation of charge]], and that a [[net charge]] doesn't accumulate at any junction -- even in the case *at any instant* in [[displacement current]] flow through a capacitor as interpreted with [[Ampere's law#for displacement current and electromagnetic induction|the general form of Ampere's law]].

#### Kirchoff's Loop rule
The [[voltage, or electric potential]] across any loop is:
$$\sum V = 0$$
Following from the fact that [[for every electric field due to a static charge distribution, the force exerted by that field is conservative]].
