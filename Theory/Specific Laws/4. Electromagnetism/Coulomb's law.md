#C21-3

An [[inverse square law]]. This can be determined with an implement similar to a [[Cavendish balance]].
Described by [[Charles Augustin de Coulomb]]. Note that [[superposition of forces]] applies for the [[electromagnetic interaction]] as well.

> The [[electromagnetic interaction]] between two [[particle|point]] [[electric charge]] is directly proportional to the product of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of the [[displacement]] between them.

$$F = k{|q_1q_2| \over r^2}$$
With $k$ as and [[permittivity of free space]] $$k = {1 \over 4\pi\epsilon_0}= 8.987551787\times 10^9 {\text{N m}^2 \over \text{C}^2} \approx 9\times10^9$$ and $k$ is related to [[speed of light]], $c$ with $$k=(10^{-7} {\text{N s}^2 \over \text{C}^2})c^2$$
We also write $$ F = {1 \over {4\pi \epsilon_0}}{|q_1q_2| \over r^2}$$
This is typically taken to be in a [[vacuum]], but on [[earth, atmosphere, water, and wildlife]] with [[air]] at $1 \text{ atm}$ this force varies by $e \approx 1/2000$.

Confirmed by a [[Van de Graaff generator]], the exponent, $2$ in the term $r^2$, doesn't vary by more than $10^{-16}$.
