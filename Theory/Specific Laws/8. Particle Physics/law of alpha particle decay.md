> [[alpha particles]] [[nuclear decay]] is possible whenever the [[mass]] of the original [[element]] is greater than the sum of the masses of the final [[element]] and the neutral [[helium]]-4 [[atom]], ${}^4\text{He}$

This can be modeled as [[quantum tunneling]] through the [[potential barrier]] formed by the [[electromagnetic interaction]], and [[strong interaction]].
