An [[empirical laws]] for [[making predictions with physics]] about [[nuclear binding]], we write [[formula]] to form a [[synthesizes a very generic, correct statement regarding a number of disparate observations|synthesis]], with $A$ the [[mass number]] in [[AZE notation]], we also write that the [[radius]] $R \propto A^{1/3}$, and $Z$ [[protons]], $N$ [[neutrons]]
- Due to the nearest-neighbor saturation, $C_1A$
- Due to the [[nucleons]] on the surface having fewer neighboars, proportional to the surface area, $-C_2A^{2/3}$ following from a computation of the [[packing fraction]] in $A$ ([[assume common, reasonable system geometry]]).
- Due to the [[Coulomb's law]] [[law of electric attraction and repulsion|repulsion]] between the [[protons]], $-C_3{Z(Z-1) \over A^{1/3}}$
- Due to the requirement of being in an [[equilibrium]] state minimizing [[energy]], we expect a balance of $N$ and $Z$ for a given $A$, this term is then $\propto (N-Z)^2/A$ the [[abuse statistical techniques|mean-square overshoot]] and we rewrite in terms of $A,Z$ $-C_4{(A-2Z)^2\over A}$
- Finally, to account for the effects of favored-pairing of , $\pm C_5A^{-4/3}$
	- Positive if $Z,N$ are both even
	- Negative if $Z, N$ are both odd
	- Zero otherwise
- Collecting these terms gives $$E_B = C_1A-C_2A^{2/3}-C_3{Z(Z-1) \over A^{1/3}}-C_4{(A-2Z)^2 \over A}\pm C_5A^{-4/3}$$
- And a [[simply fit a relationship|best-fit]] gives $$C_1=15.75 \text{ MeV}, C_2=17.80 \text{ MeV}, C_3=0.7100 \text{ MeV}, C_4=23.69 \text{ MeV}, C_5=39 \text{ MeV}$$
