#### $\beta^-$ decay
> beta-minus decay can occur whenevver the [[mass]] of the original neutral atom is larger than that of the final [[atom]]
$$\text{n} \rightarrow \text{p} + \beta^- +\bar{\nu}_e$$
- That is a [[neutrons]] decays into a [[protons]], [[electrons]], and an [[antineutrino]]
#ThumbRule occurs when $N>Z$ for large [[atomic speciation, nuclides, isotope]]

#### $\beta^+$ decay
> beta-plus decay can occur whenever the mass of the original neutral atom is at least two electron masses larger than that of the final atom
$$\text{p} \rightarrow \text{n} + \beta^+ + \nu_e$$
- That is a [[protons]] decays into a [[neutrons]], [[positron]], and a [[neutrino]]
#ThumbRule occurs when $Z>N$ for large [[atomic speciation, nuclides, isotope]]

#### $\beta^-$ capture
> electron capture can occur whenever the mass of the original neutral atom is larger than that of the final atom 
$$ \text{p}+\beta^-\rightarrow\text{n}+\nu_e $$
