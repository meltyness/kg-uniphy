#C20-1
Places a [[speed limit]] on the [[efficiency]].

#### ...the [[William Thomson, Lord Kelvin|Kelvin]]-[[Max Karl Ernst Ludwig Planck|Planck]] statement (for a [[combustion engine]])
>It is [[impossible]] for any [[thermodynamic systems|system]] undergoing a [[thermodynamic process, path|cyclic process]] where it absorbs [[heat]] from a [[hot resevoir]] at a single [[temperature]] and [[energy transformation and heat flow|converts]] it [[efficiency|completely]] into [[kinetic energy]].

#### ...the [[Rudolf Clausius]] statement of the law:
> It is [[impossible]] for any [[thermodynamic process, path|process]] to have, as its sole [[results]], the [[energy transformation and heat flow|flow]] of [[heat]] from [[temperature gradient|cold to hot]].

#### ....in terms of [[order and disorder]]
> [[material mixture|miscible]] [[fluid flow]] tends toward [[order and disorder|disorder]].
