#C18-1 

Following from [[experiment or measurement]] (i.e., this is an [[empirical laws]], follows from [[simply fit a relationship]]),

#Caution [[mass-energy equivalence]], and [[law of conservation of energy]] implies mass-conservation -- $n$ doesn't change for a [[material system]].

#### ... with the [[amount of a material]] as a [[mole]]
For the [[state variable]], an [[equation of thermodynamic state]] for an [[ideal gas]] [[formula|has]]:

1. $V$ is proportional to the moles $n$
2. $V\propto 1/p$ with $n,T$ the same or $pV\propto C$ ([[isothermically]])
3. $p\propto T$ [[kelvin]] (an [[absolute temperature]]) with $V, n$ held the same ([[isochorically]])

$$pV = nRT$$
Where $R$ is the [[gas constant]].

#Caution $\text{"ideal gas"} \Longleftrightarrow pV=nRT$ 

#### ... with the [[amount of a material]] as [[molecule]]
Following from [[gas as point particles]] $$pV=NkT$$ where $k$ is the [[Boltzmann constant]], $N$ is the number of [[molecule]] in the [[material system]].

#### ... with the [[amount of a material]] as a [[mass density]]
In #C18-1 we find the result $$\rho = {pM \over RT}$$

#### [[range of validity]]
This holds for low pressures, and high temperatures, when [[gas]] [[molecule]] are far apart, and moving quickly.

[[abstract negligible facets]] of [[intermolecular and interatomic forces]] [[collision]] -- in an ideal gas, [[elementary entities]] do not collide.
