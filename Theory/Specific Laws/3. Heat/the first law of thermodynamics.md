#C19-4 

A [[induct previous results|generalization]] of [[law of conservation of energy]], for a [[thermodynamic systems|system]], with [[energy]] $U$ in a given [[thermodynamic state]], any [[thermodynamic process, path]] gives $$\Delta U = Q-W$$
Where $Q$ is the amount of [[heat]] applied to the system, and $W$ [[work]] done by the system.

Or in grown-up terms $$\partial U = \partial Q - \partial W$$[[the change in internal energy of a system during any thermodynamic process depends only on the initial and final states, not on the path leading from one to the other]]
