#C26-3 

A [[measurement device]] and [[electrical circuit element]] for the purpose of finding the [[electromotive force, and ideal voltage source|emf]] between the [[electrical terminals]] of a [[batteries]] or [[electrical power supplies]].

Implemented with a [[d'Arsonval galvanometer]].

This is also a name for a *variable* resistor.

Part of a [[CD Player]] to provide [[human control]] the [[sound intensity level]].

Effectively one should be able to write $R(\theta)$ to a [[approximating specific complications|first-order]].
