#C43-5
In [[health and safety]] exposure to products of [[nuclear decay]], [[radioactivity]], and the ensuing [[electronic configuration, and ionization|ionizing]] [[heat radiation and absorption, thermal radiation]].

The [[SI units]] are the
- [[rad]], [[gray]] $\text{gray} \implies 1\text{ rad}= 0.01 \text{ Gy} = 0.01 \text{ J/kg}$, 
- and the effective does is given in [[sieverts]] $\text{sievert} \implies 1 \text{ Sv} = \text{RBE } \times \text{Absorbed dose (Gy)}$ 
- and named for "[[Wilhelm RÃ¶ntgen]] equivalent for man", $1 \text{ rem} = \text{RBE} \times \text{Absorbed  dose (rad)}$


#### ... [[table]] of horribleness

| X rays, and [[law of gamma decay]] | 1|
|Electrons|1.0-1.5|
|Slow neutrons|3-5|
|Protons|10|
|[[alpha particles]]|20|
|High-$A$ [[atomic speciation, nuclides, isotope]]|20|
