#C27-1 

The [[earth, atmosphere, water, and wildlife]] produces a *more-or-less* permanent [[magnetic field]]. 

The compass is a [[machine]] in [[locomotion]] for the purpose of a process called [[dead reckoning]], largely [[archaic]] has been replaced by [[global positioning system]]. As a note, [[angle]] misalignment between horizon and pole is called [[declination]].

It uses a [[permanent magnet, ferromagnetic material]] with [[buoyancy]] in a [[fluid]] to minimize [[friction force]] and, in [[equilibrium]] it aligns to the field of the earth, providing a reference-free [[angle]] to provide [[human control]].

It doubles as a [[measurement device]] in [[Hans Christian Ørsted|Ørested's experiement]] which demonstrates [[Ørsted-Laplace-Thomson law]].
