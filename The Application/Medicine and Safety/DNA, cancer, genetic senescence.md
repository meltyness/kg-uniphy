#C27-4 
A serious threat to [[health and safety]] treated with a [[cyclotron]], [[chemotherapy]], [[knife|surgery]].

Genes are composed of [[deoxyribonucleic acids]] in [[living cellular membranes, and cells more generally]] and are [[helix]]-shaped.

#### [[phenomenology]]
- In one case, [[electronic configuration, and ionization|ionizing]] [[heat radiation and absorption, thermal radiation|radiation]] such as an [[x-ray machines, and production|x-ray]] [[photon]] causes changes to [[chemical and molecular bonding]] and [[electronic configuration, and ionization]] of [[molecule]] and subsequent release of [[hydrogen]] or [[oxygen|hydroxide]].
- This is a [[disaster]] because [[hydrogen]], [[oxygen|hydroxide]] form a [[cascade]] of [[chemical reaction]] which can [[order and disorder|denature]] [[living cellular membranes, and cells more generally]], as well as [[deoxyribonucleic acids]].
