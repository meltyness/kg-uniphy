#C44-1 
A type of [[machine]] and [[measurement device]] used to explore 
- [[subatomic particle collisions]], 
- [[nuclear reactions]],
- [[subatomic particle]]
- [[force mediation]]

- [[linear particle accelerator]]
- [[cyclotron]]
- [[synchrotron]]
- [[stars]], and [[celestial mechanics]] produce [[cosmic rays]]

#### [[phenomenology]]
##### [[collision available energy]]
- In the [[center of momentum]] [[reference frame]], only the [[kinetic energy]] becomes available to the [[high-energy particle interactions]].
	- A particle $m$ (with [[rest mass]] [[energy]] $E_m$) hits a target with $M$. From [[mass-energy equivalence]], and the [[Einstein's special theory of relativity#... and law of conservation of energy]], $$E_a^2=2Mc^2E_m + (Mc^2)^2 + (mc^2)^2$$
	- If $m=M$, then $$E_a^2 = 2mc^2(E_m+mc^2)$$
	- Or for $E_m >> mc^2$ where the [[kinetic energy]] is much greater than the [[rest mass]]-equivalent energy, $$E_a = \sqrt{2mc^2E_m}$$
	- This presents a [[scaling problem]], since $E_a$ grows slowly with $E_m$ 
- To solve the [[scaling problem]] rather than having a stationary target, two beams are accelerated in the opposite direction
	- May either share the same path, or be used in a [[particle collider storage path]]

##### [[particle detection]]
Combinations of 
- [[cloud-chamber]] previously discussed, use a [[camera]] to record the [[path]]
- [[bubble-chamber]] previously discussed, as well as a [[camera]] to record
- [[semiconductors]] configured as [[photocell, and photomultiplier]]
- [[wire-chamber]] used to detect the [[electric charge]], and [[path]]
