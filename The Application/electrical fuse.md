#C25-E 

A [[electrical circuit element|component]] for [[health and safety]] and [[reliability engineering]] to [[human control|prevent]] excessive [[electrical current]] from reaching an [[complete electrical circuit]].

It does so by [[melting]] at a certain current, so the [[material phase diagram]] should have well-controlled parameters as well as [[latent heat]] and the operating 

- [[temperature]], [[pressure]], [[volume]], and of course [[electrical conductivity, and resistivity]].
