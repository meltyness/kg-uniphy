#C39-4

A type of [[microscope]], and [[measurement device]] which leverages [[human control]] over [[electrons]] and the fact that to produce an [[optical image]] with greater [[resolution]] than that can be accomplished with [[photon]], due to [[diffraction of light waves]].

#### [[phenomenology]]
- The [[resolution]] of an [[optical lens]]-based microscope is limited by the effects of [[diffraction of light waves]], and therefore the [[wavelength]]/[[electromagnetic spectrum, frequency of light]].
- Similar to the [[cathode ray tube]] uses [[magnetic field]] as a type of [[thermal contact, material system junction, optical junction or adventure|optical junction]], or [[optical lens]].
- A [[voltage, or electric potential]] $\approx 10-100\text{ kV}$ acts as the accelerator.
- Variations in [[control grid, velocity selector]] produce an amplified effect of [[precision, accuracy, uncertainty, and significant figures|uncertainty]].
	- A wavelength $\lambda \approx 0.01 \text{ nm}$ produces a [[length]] uncertainty $\Delta r \approx 0.5 \text{ nm}$.

There are two types
- [[transmission electron microscope]] permits the [[electrons]] [[incident]] to [[law of light transmission, and refraction|refraction]], through a [[thin film]] [[specimen]].
- [[scanning electron microscope]] the film has a [[net charge]] that is slightly [[law of electric attraction and repulsion|attractive]] and the [[specimen]] undergoes [[electronic configuration, and ionization]], [[electrical current]], and other such [[subatomic particle collisions]] varying the current at a collection anode, which is then correlated to the [[angle|position]] of the [[optical ray]].
