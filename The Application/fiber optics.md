#C33-3 

A [[build, or part]] which has applications in:

- [[communications]] as a [[transmitted]] [[information media]] especially when combined with a [[LASER, MASER stimulated light]]
	- Consider [[Nyquist Sampling Theorem]] as a possible limit on [[information measure paradox]].
- [[health and safety]] in the form of performing [[endoscopy]]
- [[photonic computing]]

One concern is that the [[optical terminal]] does not have [[disaster]] [[optical surface properties of materials]]. One model that could be useful is the [[derivation of a spherical and planar refractive lens]] to consider behavior at the terminal.
