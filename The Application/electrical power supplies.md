#C25-4 

Consider that in the [[reliability engineering]] of this [[machine]] for [[energy transformation and heat flow]] that one should consider the risk of excess [[electrical current]] creating excess [[temperature]].

One can increase the [[electromotive force, and ideal voltage source#formula for the internal resistor resistance model|internal resistance]].
