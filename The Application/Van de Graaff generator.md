#C22-5 

A [[machine]] to [[experiment or measurement]] the effects of [[electrostatic interactions]].

A source of [[net charge]] is applied to an outer [[metal]] [[hull or body]], and the difference in [[electric charge]] is measured between an inner, and outer shell to demonstrate that all of the charge has accumulated on the outer portion, as posited by [[in electrostatics the electric field at every point within the material of a conductor must be zero|this principle]].

This confirms [[Gauss's law]] and [[Coulomb's law]].
