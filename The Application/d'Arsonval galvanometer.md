#C26-3

A [[measurement device]] and [[machine]] for the purpose of determing details about [[electrical circuit element|circuit elements]], and [[complete electrical circuit]], [[electronic devices]], etc.

A [[electrical wire, or terminal|wire]] is placed near a [[permanent magnet, ferromagnetic material]], and a [[coil spring]] is attacheed so that a [[torque]] and [[kinematics of rotational motion of rigid bodies|rotational motion]] deflects.

This can be configured with a large serial resistor, or large parallel resistor to vary the [[human control]] over the ranges measured, must have [[full-scale deflection]] correctly calibrated.
