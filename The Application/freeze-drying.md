A [[machine|process]] by which food is
- [[freezing|frozen]] and [[deposition and epitaxy|deposited]] at below the [[triple point of water]]to take advantage of an [[material phase subspeciation, allotropy, polymorphism, and hysteresis|allotrope]] of ice that doesn't damage the structure of the [[food]]
