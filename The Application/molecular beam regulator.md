#C18-5 

A type of [[machine]] to provide [[human control]] over [[molecular speeds]].

Quite a bit like [[Maxwell's Demon]]

#### [[phenomenology]]
It does so with a [[vacuum chamber]], and a 

- [[heating coil]] as a [[order and disorder|disordered]] source of [[molecule]]
- [[molecular occlusion slits]] which produce [[molecule]] with a [[probability density|regular range of]] [[direction]]
- [[kinematics of rotational motion of rigid bodies|rotating]] slits so that only molecules with a speed of [[how much on average|around]] $v$ pass $$v={\omega x \over \theta}$$
- More precisely, since there must be some variation $\partial \omega$, $\partial x$, $\partial \theta$ which would result in a variation to the measured speed (as well as second, and third-order such effects) it's possible to predict the measurements will be a [[probability density]] with [[physical quantities]] [[speed]].
- The [[formula]] may be read "Within any population of molecules, $N$ we have an [[frequency of occurence]] of $v$ with $f(v)$" $$f(v)dv = {dN \over N}$$
- Concretely, the probability than any molecule will have speed in the interval $[v, v+dv]$ is $f(v)dv$
- The [[expectation value]] of speed is $$E[v] = \int_0^\infty vf(v)dv$$
- The [[root-mean square]] is $$v_\text{rms}=\sqrt{E[v^2]}=\sqrt{\int_0^\infty v^2f(v)dv}$$
