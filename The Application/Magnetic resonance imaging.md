In [[health and safety]] this provides [[stroboscopic photography]] through solid [[material]].

- A very strong [[magnetic field]] is produced by a [[solenoid, and current loops]]. $\approx 1.5 \text{ T}$
- The [[nucleus]] of each [[hydrogen]] [[atom]] has a [[magnetic dipole]] [[magnetic moment|moment]] which experiences a [[torque]].
- An [[electromagnetic waves and light]] is used with a specific [[electromagnetic spectrum, frequency of light]] which disturbs the dipole alignment for only those with the specific mode held by [[hydrogen]], the others [[frozen out]]
	- [[hypotheses]].
