#C27-8 

- A [[in series]] motor connects so that the [[solenoid, and current loops]] are in series with the [[rotor]].
- A [[in parallel|shunt]] motor connects so that the [[solenoid, and current loops]] are in parallel with the [[rotor]].


#### ... [[electrical power dissipation]] in a motor
The power input it $P=V_\text{ab} I$. $V_\text{ab}$ results from the [[force]] due to the [[magnetic field]] onto the [[electrical current]], which produces an [[electromotive force, and ideal voltage source|electromotive force]], $\mathcal{E}$, called "back emf." This effect is what makes an [[alternator]] useful. 

In a series motor there exists an internal resistance $r$ so given a current $I$, the elements have $$V_\text{ab} = \mathcal{E} + Ir$$
