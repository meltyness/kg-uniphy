A type of [[machine]] and [[material]] for providing [[human control]] of [[displacement]] between [[rigid body]]. It experiences the [[tension force]] can be modeled with [[tensile-compressive stress]] and has a high [[breaking stress]]. It can also be used as a [[wave medium]].

A [[pulley]] can be used to convert the [[kinematics along a straight line|linear motion]] of a rope into [[kinematics of rotational motion of rigid bodies|rotational motion]].
