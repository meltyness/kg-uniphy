#C6-E 

In a simple machine, a [[force]] $F_{\text{in}}$ is applied to the system and results in an output for $F_{\text{out}}$ to the object that is moved. 

### Mechanical Advantage
For such a machine the ratio, $F_{\text{out}} / F_{\text{in}}$, is called the [[mechanical advantage|actual mechanical advantage]].

And for given [[displacement]] realized by the action the [[mechanical advantage|ideal mechanical advantage]] is $s_{\text{in}} / s_{\text{out}}$.

### [[Efficiency]]
The efficiency of a simple machine [[formula|is given by]] $e={W_{\text{out}} / W_{\text{in}}}={AMA/IMA}$
