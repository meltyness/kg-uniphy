An important kind of [[mirror]], or [[machine]], that is [[build, or part|part]] of [[telescope]] and a [[communications antenna]]

- [[glass]] [[fluid]] near its [[Freezing point]]
- [[kinematics of rotational motion of rigid bodies|Spinning]] so as to produce a [[meniscus]]
- It can be allowed to [[solid|solidify]]

producing a [[rigid body]] in the shape of, a [[parabola]].

An interesting facet of this process is that it also depends on the presence of [[viscosity]]. Note that parabolas are also characteristic of [[turbulent flow]].

#WaitWhat how do we [[enumerate all apparently permissible configurations]] for the remaining conics?
