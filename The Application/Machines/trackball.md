#Custom-1 

A device for measuring x-y displacement for the purposes of [[build, or part|building]] a [[pointing device]].

This [[machine|device]] is an example of a [[Nonholonomic systems|nonholonomic system]]. Since it will exhibit:
- rolling without slipping x related to
- translation x (degree of freedom)

- rolling without slipping y related to
- translation y (degree of freedom)

Two [[degrees of freedom]].

However, $\theta, \phi$ of the ball can be varied by taking different paths, they call for additional [[generalized coordinates]], a total of 4.

Therefore, the system is non-holonomic.
