A system modeled by [[surface gravity]] and [[tension force]] resulting in [[periodic motion and oscillation]]. 

A [[Foucault pendulum]] is free

We take $\tau_z = -(mg)(d\sin\theta)$ to be the restoring [[torque]].

For small $\theta$ we have that $\sin\theta \approx \theta$, therefore we can [[derivation]] the [[formula]] with $$\sum\tau_z = I\alpha_z$$ and $$-(mgd)\theta = I{d^2\theta \over dt^2}$$
so that $$\omega = \sqrt{mgd \over I} \ \ \ \ \ \ T=2\pi\sqrt{I \over mgd}$$
Point inertia would have $I = md^2$ so that we then have $$\omega = \sqrt{g \over d}$$which is good up to about $\Theta = 15^\circ$ for [[oscillatory period]] $\epsilon \le 0.5\text{\%}$.
