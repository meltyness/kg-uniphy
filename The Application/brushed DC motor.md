#C27-8

A type of [[electric motor]] can be described as [[motion of charges in a magnetic field]]. A [[machine]] for producing [[locomotion]], also a [[electrical circuit element]] in a larger [[complete electrical circuit]].

#### ... [[phenomenology]]
- A [[rotor]] which is an open loop of [[electrical conductivity, and resistivity|conductor]] which is free to [[kinematics of rotational motion of rigid bodies|rotate]] is mounted on an [[axis]].
- The end of the rotor has a [[commutator]] which connects to [[brushes or brush terminals]].
- An [[electrical current]] flows near a [[permanent magnet, ferromagnetic material|permanent magnet]] to produce a [[torque]] across its [[magnetic dipole]].
- The terminals then connect temporarily through only the commutator, and with the accrued [[kinetic energy of a rigid body|kinetic energy]] carrying through the gap where there is no incident torque. 
- [[steady-state]] occurs when the $\sum\tau=0$
	- [[how much on average|average]] [[torque]] through a rotation is the same as the 
	- [[fluid resistance]]
	- [[contact force]] in the 
		- [[bearings]], and 
		- [[brushes or brush terminals]]-[[commutator]] system.

#### ... additional notes
- More magnets can be introduced to smooth out the [[angular velocity]].
- The sense can be inverted so that the rotor is a permanent magnet, and the torque is produced by modulating the [[magnetic field]] from [[solenoid, and current loops]] coils.
