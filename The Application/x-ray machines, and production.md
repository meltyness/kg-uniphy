#C38-7

Production of x-rays with $\lambda_0 \approx 10^{-12} - 10^{-9}$ 

#### [[phenomenology]]
- #ThumbRule produced via the [[invert the sense of common questions|inverse]] of the [[photoelectric effect]].
- A brief description of a machine employed by [[Wilhelm RÃ¶ntgen]]
- A [[heating coil]] produces [[escape]] [[electrons]]
- They are attracted to an [[electrical wire, or terminal|anode]] target composed of a [[kind of material]] [[electrical conductivity, and resistivity|conductor]]
- Two [[emission]] processes take place
	- [[bremsstahlung]] "[[braking]] [[heat radiation and absorption, thermal radiation|radiation]]"
		- Some electrons are stopped by the target completely, or slowed.
		- The [[electrons]] have [[elementary charge]], $e^-$ 
		- Gains [[kinetic energy]] $eV_\text{ac}$ from the coil to the target
		- For those that are *completely* stopped gives an implied maximum of $$eV_\text{ac} = hf_\text{max} = {hc \over \lambda_\text{min}}$$
	- [[avalanche]] type processes
		- These depend on the [[electronic configuration, and ionization]] and [[element]] or [[molecule]] composing the anode target, for the [[resonance]] produced and the [[emission spectra, absorption spectra and diffraction grating, spectroscopy|x-ray emission spectra]] produced.

#### Application
- [[Compton scattering]]
- [[computed tomography]]
- [[facilities]] in terms of looking for [[breaking stress]]
- Can also cause [[DNA, cancer, genetic senescence]]
