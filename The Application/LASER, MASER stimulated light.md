A laser has two [[mirror]], and a [[standing electromagnetic waves]] is established between them one has a small gap to provide [[illumination]]. Provides good [[human control]] over the [[electromagnetic spectrum, frequency of light]] which is [[light emission|emitted]].

A [[reliability engineering]] perspective is that a HeNe laser produces [[monochromatic]] to within $10^{-9}$
about $\lambda_0 = 632.8 \text{ nm}$.

In addition to LASER stimulation of HeNe described below, and associated [[population inversion]] the effect can also be produced
- In a MASER with larger [[molecule|molecules]] and associated [[electric charge freedom]]
- A [[light emitting diode]] can be used to produce 
- [[carbon]] [[oxygen|dioxide]] $\text{CO}_2$ [[gas]], [[metastable state]] are produced via [[adiabatic]] expansion.

#### [[phenomenology]]
- A source of [[electromagnetic waves and light]] which are [[coherent waves]], nearly [[monochromatic]], 
- [[spontaneous emission]]
	- A kind of [[photon]] [[emission]] where 
	- An [[atom]] with an [[electronic configuration, and ionization|excited state]] $E$ above ground, then can absorb a [[photon]] $E=hf$
	- After the [[atom excitation lifetime]], a [[photon]] is then emitted, 
		- phase and direction are [[random motion]], with the [[atom excitation lifetime]]
- [[light amplification]] and [[stimulated emission]]
	- A kind of [[photon]] [[emission]] where
	- [[photon]]s are incident onto excited atoms,
	- A [[resonance]] effect causes a second photon to be emitted matching the 
		- [[electromagnetic spectrum, frequency of light|frequency]]
		- [[optical ray]]
		- [[phase]]
		- [[polarization angle]]
- In order to shift the material up to those states we must produce a [[population inversion]]
	- Via the [[Maxwell-Boltzmann Distribution]] we can glean
		- Number of atoms in a distribution with a given [[energy]] [[states]]
			- #Caution each [[energy-state relationship]] can have unique physical parameters, like a spring that has been compressed or extended.
		- With a gas at $T$, the atoms $n_i$ in $E_i$ has $n_i=Ae^{-E_i/kT}$ where $A\propto n$ total substance
		- Therefore most atoms have energy concentrated in low states
	- Only specific states undergo participate in the stimulated emission
		- Like a [[cathode ray tube]] we run a [[electrical current#variable situations|current through the gas at an]] [[electronic configuration, and ionization|ionizing]] [[voltage, or electric potential|voltage]].
		- [[helium]] atoms store energy in a [[metastable state]] [[electronic configuration, and ionization]]
			- Atom is excited into $\text{2s}$ and under [[subatomic particle collisions]] with [[neon]] drops back to $\text{1s}$
			- helium-neon collisions produce $\text{2p}\rightarrow\text{5s}$ in neon atoms
			- [[neon]] $\text{5s}\rightarrow\text{3p}$ occurs to produce $\text{632.8 nm}$ light emissions
- A pair of [[mirror]] is used to maintain the energy in the system and increase the amount of stimulated emission happening, one of which is subject to [[law of dielectric reflection, and phase shifting]], to permit $\approx5\text{\%}$  of the incident [[light intensity]] to form the beam.
- Stimulated emission, a bit like scattering, in this case results in widespread [[synchronization]] across the [[material system]]
