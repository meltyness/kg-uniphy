#C25-4 

A [[build, or part]] of a [[combustion engine]] or for [[facilities]]-scale [[electrical power transmission]] that [[electrical energy storage, generation, and transmission|converts]] the [[kinetic energy of a rigid body#In rotational motion|rotational kinetic energy]] into [[voltage, or electric potential]] and [[electrical potential energy]] to charge [[batteries]]. A related technology is the [[slidewire generator]] toy.

Operates off of [[Faraday's law of induction]], while similar in construction to [[electric motor]]

By rotating a coil in a [[magnetic field]] from a permanent magnet, an [[electromotive force, and ideal voltage source]] is generated, a [[slip-ring]] can be used to generate [[AC circuits]].

Note one can also reorganize the [[brushes or brush terminals]] and produce [[electrical rectification]], and organizing them in a [[cascade]] can produce a nearly flat [[electromotive force, and ideal voltage source|emf]].
