#C27-5 

A mass spectrometer is a [[measurement device]] for determining details about the [[mass]] of [[atom]] and [[molecule]] in a [[specimen]]. It does so by:

- [[electronic configuration, and ionization|ionizing]] particles in a gas to produce a positive [[net charge]] on [[molecular motion]].
- Using a [[control grid, velocity selector]] on a [[gas]].
- Applying a [[magnetic field]] and using [[motion of charges in a magnetic field]] with [[formula]] $$R={mv \over |q|B}={p \over |q|B}$$ to determine the [[mass]] of the [[material mixture]].

This type of [[machine]] lead to the discovery of [[atomic speciation, nuclides, isotope]] in [[neon]], [[Francis William Aston]].
