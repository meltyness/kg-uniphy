#C17-7 

A [[deformation and elasticity|thin]] [[rope|wire]] of [[tungsten]] is [[heat]] to a high [[temperature]] via the [[electromagnetic interaction]], subsequently properties of [[ideal blackbody]] result in [[heat radiation and absorption, thermal radiation]] of [[electromagnetic waves and light]] at certain [[electromagnetic spectrum, frequency of light]] as a [[fingerprint]]. Provides [[illumination]].

Similar theoretically to a [[heating coil]].

#WaitWhat #C25-E suggests possibly [[disaster]] burnout modeled as [[cavitation]] and [[parallel plate capacitor#derivation of the pressure|capacitor pressure]]
