In [[facilities]] this is a type of [[machine]] to ensure that [[earth, atmosphere, water, and wildlife|cloud to ground lightning strikes]] do not damage buildings...

They do so by making it so that the greatest [[electric charge]] [[material system charge polarization|accumulation]] in the building system is [[electrical properties of materials|connected]] to [[ground]] and provides a large, [[temperature|cold]] [[electrical conductivity, and resistivity|conductive]] sink for the [[capacitive breakdown]] and [[electrical current]] flow that lightning strikes are.
