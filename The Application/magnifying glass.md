#C34-7

An [[optical instrument]] that uses a [[converging lens]]. The subject modeled as an [[extended object]] is brought to the [[focal point, and focal length|focal point]] of the lens, and it appears to be far from the viewer, as could be gleaned using [[principal ray method for lenses]]. Since the [[virtual image]] then has infinite lateral [[optical magnification]], we must consider the [[angular size]].

Limited to $3\times, 4\times$ magnification without special optics.
