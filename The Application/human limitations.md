#C16-1 

In [[health and safety]], there exist safe and [[human control]] limits, such as the following. Exceeding these boundaries may constitute [[weapons]].

- [[sound]] can only be heard from $20\text{ Hz} - 20,000 \text{ Hz}$
	- [[timbre|resonance]] circa $\text{3,500 Hz}$
- [[container|lung capacity]] for [[air]] of $\text{1.75 L}$ 
	- must have a certain [[oxygen]] [[concentration]] and be free of [[contamination]].
	- must be able to expel [[combustion]] [[waste products]].
- Humans hear with a certain [[timbre]] called [[loudness]].
- Must [[speak]] to engage in most [[communications]]
- [[sound intensity level]] should be kept lower than $\text{1.0 W/m}^2$ or $120 \text{dB}$ the threshold of pain.
- [[collision]] kept slow, as with a [[gun]]
- [[shear stress]] kept low, as with [[knife]]
- [[temperature]] kept low, as with [[Atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] or [[room temperature]].
- [[spring potential energy]] kept low, as with [[mousetrap]]
- [[apparent weight]] kept low as with [[planes and flight]] to prevent [[vasovagal response]]
- [[bulk stress]] as with [[the bends]] in a [[submarine]]
- the [[impulse]] experienced in a [[car accident]] 
- Total body [[water]], may necessitate a need for a [[canteen]]
- Total [[heat]] into the body should be aware that the [[heat capacity and specific heat]] of human biomass is approximately $3480 \text{ J/Kg K}$
- As well as [[energy]] through [[digestion]]
- [[electrical current]] and [[electrical conductivity, and resistivity]]
	- Human resistivity is $\approx 5.0 \ \Omega \text{m}$, skin resistivity is thwarted with [[water]] and [[salt]]
	- $\approx 100 \text{ mA}$ can produce a lethal [[human shock]]
	- $\approx 100 \text{ V}$ [[voltage, or electric potential]] needed to produce this
- in terms of [[electromagnetic spectrum, frequency of light]] must be [[visible]]
- [[light intensity]] [[difference|contrast]] as in [[road]] [[visual sign]] [[retroreflectivity]] and [[headlights]]
- bad [[optical image]] [[resolution]] in [[the human eye]]
- [[electronic configuration, and ionization|ionizing]] [[heat radiation and absorption, thermal radiation|radiation]] can cause [[DNA, cancer, genetic senescence]] as in [[radiation dosimetry]]
- and so on for all interesting [[physical quantities]]
