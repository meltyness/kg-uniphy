>"According to [Edwin H. Land](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_H._Land "Edwin H. Land"), it was discovered in 1852[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herapathite#cite_note-1) by [William Bird Herapath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Bird_Herapath "William Bird Herapath"), a [Bristol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol "Bristol") surgeon and chemist. One of his pupils found that adding [iodine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iodine "Iodine") to the [urine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine "Urine") of a dog that had been fed [quinine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinine "Quinine") produced unusual green crystals. Herapath noticed while studying the crystals under a [microscope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscope "Microscope") that they appeared to polarize light.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herapathite#cite_note-2)"
