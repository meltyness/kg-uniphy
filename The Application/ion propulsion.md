#C23-1 

A [[machine]] for [[locomotion]] of [[manmade satellites]], by generating [[thrust force]]. Remarkably similar in theory of operationD to a [[cathode ray tube]].

- A [[atomic period|noble]] [[gas]] [[propellant]] such as [[xenon]] is [[container|stored]], each atom has 54 electrons.
- and [[collision|bombarded]] with free [[electrons]],
	- In the discharge chamber an [[electrical potential energy]] draws the electrons, and a [[magnetic field]] prevents them from [[electrical current|flowing]]
	- Generation of free electrons is performed via [[incandescent light bulbs|thermionic emission]]
- which [[electronic configuration, and ionization|ionizes]] some [[atom|atoms]] in the [[material system]]
	- This is a [[material phase change]] to a [[plasma]]. 
- This plasma has a neutral [[net charge]]
- **Screen grid**: The ionized Xenon atoms in [[random motion]] exhibit [[molecular motion]] towards a positively charged grid that [[occlude or filter|repels all but the most energetic]]
- **Accelerator grid**: Those positive ions that escape $v>V^*$ are attracted to a large negative charge, this substance is polar and composed of those ions.
- **Neutralizer**: [[electrons|Electrons]] are joined back into the escaping [[plasma]] to prevent a [[net charge]] from appearing on the craft. 
- The escaping plasma causes a net [[thrust force]] to appear changing [[momentum]] with the change in [[mass]].
