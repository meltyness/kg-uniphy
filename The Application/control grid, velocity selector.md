#C27-5

In a [[cathode ray tube]], this [[build, or part]] [[occlude or filter]] [[subatomic particle]] using perpendicular [[electric field]] [[magnetic field]] to produce an [[equilibrium]] in one dimension for particles of a specific [[speed]], with [[formula]] $$v={E \over B}$$
This was used as a [[measurement device]] for determining the [[electron e-m ratio]].

Additionally, [[mass spectrometers, gas chromatography]] operate off these principles. Discovered by [[Wilhelm Wien]]
