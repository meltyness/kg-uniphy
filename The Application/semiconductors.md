Semiconductors are [[kind of material]] that can place [[human control]] of [[electrical properties of materials]].

#### ... [[phenomenology]]
- [[silicon]], [[germanium]] are common choices for their [[crystal]], and [[lattice electronic energy]] and [[energy band structure]], with a somewhat higher [[energy band gap]] between the [[conduction energy band]] and the [[valence energy band]], $\approx 0.67 - 1.12 \text{ eV}$ at [[room temperature]], the [[semiconductor intrinsic conductivity]]
- The [[electronic state density]] is different for these materials than for metal.
- [[electric hole]] also are incident in [[element]] for [[current density]] in a semiconductor.
- Under [[crystal doping]], donors and acceptors introduce new [[electron energy level]] into the crystal at a given [[concentration]].
	- Donors increase [[electrons]] [[density]] and produce $n$-type semiconductors 
		- typically from Group V ($\text{N,P,As,Sb,Bi}$)
		- [[nitrogen]], [[phosphorus]], [[arsenic]], [[antimony]], [[bismuth]] respectively
	- Accepts increase [[electric hole]] [[density]] and produce $p$-type semiconductors
		- typically from Group III ($\text{B, Al, Ga, In, Tl}$)
		- [[boron]], [[Aluminum]], [[gallium]], [[indium]], [[thallium]] respectively
	- If both such impurities are introduced, they are called [[compensated semiconductors]].
- Assessments can be performed with the [[Hall effect]]

#### ... [[formula]] for a [[p-n junction diode]]
- For $V=\text{junction voltage}$ at the [[thermal contact, material system junction, optical junction or adventure|material junction]] of the two [[material system]] [[semiconductors]] with differing [[crystal doping]], then the [[current-voltage relationship]] is $$I=I_S(\exp({eV/kT})-1)$$
- [[generation and recombination]] models local [[escape]] of [[elementary entities]] in the [[crystal]].
- [[diode breakdown modes]]
	- [[avalanche breakdown]]
	- [[Zener breakdown]]
- [[photovoltaic effect]] produces an increase in [[elementary entities]] when the [[crystal]] is exposed to [[photon]], also used in [[photovoltaic cells]], [[charge-coupled device]], [[camera]]

#### ... [[formula]] for a [[transistor]]
- [[bipolar junction transistor]]
- [[MOSFET, VLSI]]
