#C16-9

In [[planes and flight]] a [[mass|massive]] [[machine]] moving with greater than the [[speed of sound]] is said to be supersonic. The [[combustion engine]] or [[turbine]] generates [[sound waves]].

As the plane crosses the [[wavefront]] of its emissions, a large [[energy]] accumulates in a single [[wave pulse]]. This is called a [[shockwave, or sonic boom]]

#### [[explanation]]
As the jet approaches the speed of sound in the [[wave medium]], $$\lambda_\text{in front} = {v-v_s \over f_s}$$
An [[aerodynamics]] effect increases [[fluid resistance]] from the [[air]], called the [[sound barrier]]

Successive [[wave pulse]] have a [[wavefront]], which creates a large high [[pressure]], high [[mass density]] [[test volume]] of [[air]] in front of the jet. Once that barrier is crossed, the successive cone of the [[shockwave, or sonic boom]] has an angle$$\sin{\alpha}={vt \over v_s t}={v \over v_s}$$
