#C13-E 

A [[machine]] to generate [[locomotion]] through [[rolling]]. It goes in a [[car]]

- A [[build, or part|part]] of the system is called a [[piston]], and may be considered to be under [[simple harmonic motion]]. 
- A [[gas]] [[propellant]] is used, and in turn [[dynamics of rigid bodies]] and [[kinematics of rotational motion of rigid bodies]] produces the effect.
- A [[radiator cap]] is used to control [[temperature]] and [[pressure]]
- It performs this using [[combustion]]
- The [[explosion]] is kicked off by a [[spark]] made by a [[spark plug]] which is a pair of [[self inductance, and inductors|inductors]] coupled to release energy at the right time.


It is [[hypotheses|suspect]] that the [[widespread proliferation]] is the cause of [[global climate change]]

#### Additional considerations
- 4 stroke: intake stroke, compression stroke, ignition, power stroke, exhaust stroke.
- A compression ratio, $r$ determines timing in the ignition stroke (before spontaneous combusion due to the increase in temperature compressing a gas)
- An [[adiabatic]] process
- [[Nicolaus Otto|The Otto Cycle]] is the description, nominal values are $r=8$, $\gamma=1.4$ gives $$e=1-{1 \over r^{\gamma - 1}}$$

#### [[thermodynamics]] description
- A part of the system is called the [[working substance]], the [[kind of material]] comprised of the [[material mixture]] of [[propellant]] and [[air]], typically.
- It undergoes a [[thermodynamic process, path#Cyclicality|cyclical process]] subject to [[the first law of thermodynamics]].
- the [[explosion]] is harvested and converted into [[kinetic energy]] in the [[piston]].
- Waste [[heat]] from the process in the components and the [[material mixture]] is allowed to leave through the [[hot exhaust]] and to be drawn away by [[heat convection]] through the [[engine cooling system]].
	- In a [[turbine]], [[gas]] [[water|steam]] is heated to produce [[kinematics of rotational motion of rigid bodies|rotation]], and then [[condensing]] to maintain the cycle.

The cyclicality implies $$Q=W$$
A [[hot resevoir]] is the [[chemical potential energy]] or the [[thermal energy]] producing the motion.
The need to tap the [[cold resevoir]] determines the rate at which the cycle is regulated.

During one [[period|cycle]], with those values, this gives [[efficiency]] $$e = {W \over Q_H}=1+{Q_C \over Q_H} = 1 - \bigg|{Q_C \over Q_H}\bigg|$$
