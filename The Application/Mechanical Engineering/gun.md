#C6-1 

A gun uses [[chemical potential energy]] to produce a [[kinematics of a projectile|projectile]] with a very high [[speed]], as a [[weapons]].

A model of this is that [[law of conservation of energy]] leads to the conversion of the [[energy]] in the [[energy storage and transmission|gun powder]] into [[kinetic energy]] of a small [[mass]] called a [[bullet]].
