#C16-4

A type of [[machine]] for generating [[sound waves]] under [[human control]].

For $n=1$ corresponding to A440,
$$f(n)=(\sqrt[12]{2})^{n-49}\times 440 \text{ Hz}$$


Often need to be [[tuning fork|tuned]].

In the scope of an [[organ]] the [[mouth]] of the pipe marks the [[mechanical wave antinode]] for [[pressure]], thus providing [[human control]] of the [[fundamental frequency]]
