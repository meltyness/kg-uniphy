#C16-4 

In an organ a

- [[fluid flow]] of [[air]]
	- supplied by a [[blower]] 
	- around $10^3 \text{Pa}$ of [[pressure|gauge pressure]]
- it is forced into a [[turbulent flow]] by the [[mouth]] as a form of [[forced oscillation]]
	- [[resonance]] into the [[container]] 
- Open pipe behavior corresponds to [[wave medium boundary|free boundary]]
	- following from argument for [[fundamental frequency]], 
	$$ f_n = {nv \over 2L}=nf_1 \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (n=1,2,3,...)$$
- Closed pipe behavior corresponding to [[wave medium boundary|fixed boundary]]
	- a [[transverse wave]] [[displacement]] [[mechanical wave antinode]] sits at the closed end of the pipe, because the displacement changes direction and [[interference of mechanical waves]].
	$$f_n={nv \over 4L}=nf_1 \ \ \ \ \ \ (n = 1,3,5,...)$$- This case is similar to the idea of a [[musical instrument|stringed instrument]] with a [[slip-ring]] at one end.

This also results in [[timbre]].
