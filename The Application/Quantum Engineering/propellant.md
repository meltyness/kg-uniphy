#C8-5 

A type of [[fluid]] for [[energy storage and transmission]] stores and releases [[chemical potential energy]] in a process called [[combustion]].

- [[hydrogen]] is proposed but [[the concentration of hydrogen in the atmosphere is low because it is buoyant, and can easily reach escape speed]], and so [[electrolysis]] must be used to [[concentration|concentrate]] it.
