#C35-4

A common [[build, or part|part]] and [[phenomena of nature]] which has certain properties important in [[friction force]] as a [[fluid]]. Also known to produce certain interesting [[interference of light waves]] 

#### ... [[interference of light waves]]
A distinct [[sorting]] of [[electromagnetic waves and light]] can be generated by a thin film.

##### ... [[formula]]
- For a [[glass]] wedge, [[air]], and a [[mirror]], 
- A [[monochromatic]] [[optical ray]] is [[incident]] on the glass
	- The ray is reflected and refracted by the glass near the air
	- The ray transmitted into the air is then reflected, and refracted back through the glass, a distance $t$ from the bottom of the glass.
- Two clear situations arise for $2t$ the excess path
	- Where $2t$ is constructive, $m\lambda$ 
	- Where $2t$ is desctructive, $m(\lambda + \frac{1}{2})$
- At the interface of the two glasses, $t=0$ another effect becomes obvious
	- For $t=0$ would seem to imply constructive with $m\lambda=0$ however another effect takes hold,
	- #ProofDeferred at this [[wave medium boundary]] [[law of dielectric reflection, and phase shifting]], and the case where $n_a=n_b$ yields this effect $$E_r={{n_a - n_b} \over {n_a+n_b}}E_i$$
This highlights two possible cases, where there is a relative phase shift due to the nature of the reflection taking place, we have the following table [[table]]

| |Constructive bands|Destructive bands|
|-|-|-|
|Phase shift ($n_a>n_b$)|$2t=(m+\frac{1}{2})\lambda$|$2t=m\lambda$|
|No Phase Shift ($n_a<n_b$)|$2t=m\lambda$|$2t=(m+\frac{1}{2})\lambda$|

##### ... [[phenomenology]]
- A thin film of a [[kind of material]] like a [[lubricant]], [[surfactant]], or [[oil]] is formed on a flat [[surface]]
- [[reflection of electromagnetic waves]] occurs at a [[thermal contact, material system junction, optical junction or adventure|optical junction]] with the [[geometric optics|optical geometry]] situated such that the [[incident]] [[optical ray]] is reflected from
	- The outer boundary, is subject to [[law of specular reflection]]
	- The interior boundary, is subject to the subtances [[index of refraction]] and [[law of light transmission, and refraction|transmitted]] before being finally reflected, taking a different path.
	- This can be treated with the understanding that in [[the motion of light, and light propagation]] an [[optical ray]] can be simultaneously reflected and refracted.
- Upon arrival at [[the human eye]], or production of some other such [[optical image]] some [[electromagnetic spectrum, frequency of light|wavelengths]] interfere constructively, and others destructively depending on the thickness of the film.
- Small positional [[random motion|variations]] in the thickness of the film lead to the striking banding.
- This does not occur in thick films because the emergent light will no longer be coherent.
