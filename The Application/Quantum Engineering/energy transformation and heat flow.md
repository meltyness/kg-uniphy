#C17-1 

There are multiple relevant processes to consider, so to attempt to [[enumerate all apparently permissible configurations]],

#### ... in [[thermal conduction]]
#WaitWhat ... what is a [[heating coil|heat coil]]? #GotIt [[subatomic particle collisions]]

#### ... in [[heat convection]]
How [[temperature]] varies in a [[test volume]] via [[fluid flow]]

#### ... in [[heat radiation and absorption, thermal radiation]]
How [[temperature]] varies in a [[molecule]] as part of a [[material system]] due to [[electromagnetic waves and light]].
