Used in [[health and safety]] as a [[weapons]] or sort of [[knife]] against [[living cellular membranes, and cells more generally]] that have become  [[DNA, cancer, genetic senescence]]. As well as a [[build, or part]] of [[particle colliders]].


#### [[phenomenology]]
- Governed by [[motion of charges in a magnetic field]] $$\omega = {v \over r} = {|q|B \over r}$$
- Two sources of [[electric field]], called "dees" are subject to [[AC circuits|alternating]] [[electrical current]] precisely synchronized to increase the [[radius]] each [[period]].
- A [[subatomic particle]] with a [[net charge]] is accelerated to $$K_\text{max} = \frac{1}{2}mv_\text{max}^2 = {q^2B^2R^2 \over 2m}$$
