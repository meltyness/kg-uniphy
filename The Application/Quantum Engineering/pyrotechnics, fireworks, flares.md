#C8-5 

These are a type of [[weapons]] which store energy as [[chemical potential energy]], exhibit [[kinematics of a projectile|projectile motion]], and have a [[center of mass]], where the [[state change]] complicates the analysis. 

When a shell explodes in air, since no [[externality|external forces]] will have acted, the [[center of gravity]] must be in [[dynamic equilibrium]].
