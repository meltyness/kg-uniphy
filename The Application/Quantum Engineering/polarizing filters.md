#C33-5
A [[build, or part|part]] of a [[machine]] that provides [[human control]] of [[polarization of optical rays]], as well as [[light intensity]] to prevent breaching [[human limitations]].

#### ... [[phenomenology]] for [[kind of material]] to [[linearly polarized]] [[electromagnetic waves and light|light]]
Depends on the [[electromagnetic spectrum, frequency of light]] being operated on

- At [[microwaves]], [[in parallel|parallel]] [[dielectric, and dielectric strength|insulated]] [[electrical conductivity, and resistivity|conducting]] [[electrical wire, or terminal|wires]].
	- This results in [[electrical power dissipation]] in the direction of [[electrical current]]
	- Waves perpendicular pass through, unaffected.
- [[Polaroid]]
	- [[degrees of freedom]] of [[polyatomic]] [[polymer]] with a large number of [[molecule]] create [[intermolecular motion of charges]] in one direction hence dissipating that portion of the [[electric field]].
	- This creates a sharp [[optical junction refractive dispersion]] based on the incident [[electromagnetic wave polarization]].
- [[liquid crystals]]

[[light intensity]] varies with [[Malus's law]].
