#### ... for a planar mirror
- An observer, a mirror, and an object are present.
- Establish an [[object distance]], $s$ which is the shortest distance from the object to the mirror.
	- This is equal to the [[image distance]], $s'$ which is the virtual distance between the object as it appears in the virtual image from the mirror.
- An [[optical ray]] with an angle $\theta$ off the object distance is emitted, and following from [[law of specular reflection]] creates $\theta_a  = \theta_r$ towards the observer.
- A [[cascade|pair]] of such [[mirror]] can produce the effect where the image of an image can appear.
- Since the sense of rays towards the mirror are changes these are called [[optically reversed]].
- For an [[extended object]], this results in *unity*, (non-present) [[optical magnification]] that could otherwise be [[optically erect]] or [[optically inverted]].
	- The [[optical image]] will have the same [[definite size and a definite shape]] as the [[extended object]]

The [[object-image relationship]] is then $$s=-s'$$
