#### ... [[approximating specific complications|approximate]] model
We can find the [[object-image relationship]] via the following suppositions:
- The lens is thin, composed of two spherical lenses therefore the focal points $F_1, F_2$ are $f$ from the [[optical vertex]], and $f>0$ (the left lens focuses to $F_2$, the right lens to $F_1$)
- #WaitWhat where did the [[index of refraction]] go?!?!?!
- Trace two [[optical ray]] from $Q$ situated at $y$ above the [[optical axis]]
	- One ray parallel to the [[optical axis]]
	- One ray through the [[optical vertex]]
- Our assumptions lead to the consequences
	- that the parallel ray passes through $F_2$ on its way to $Q'$
	- that the direct ray passes through $O$ (the midpoint/[[optical vertex]]) to $Q'$ undeflected.
- We establish a [[differential equation, or principle]] with $s'-f$ measuring the image from $F_2$.
- This results in an [[optically inverted]] [[optical image]] with [[optical magnification]] and [[object-image relationship]]: $${1 \over s} + {1 \over s'} = {1 \over f} \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ m={-s' \over s}$$
- Additionally this does not result in [[optically reversed]] images.
- We can use [[sign rules of geometric optics]] for any thin-lens system.
	- When $s>f$, $s' > 0$.
	- An object placed within the first focal point, $s<f$ produces $s'<0$ and the image is on the same side of the lens as the object, [[virtual image]], [[optically erect]], and $|s'|>s$.

#WaitWhat how does this *really* follow from [[paraxial approximation for a spherical mirror]]?? #GotIt it's indeed paraxial and approximative.

#### [[phenomenology]]
- A thin double spherical lens has two [[focal point, and focal length|focal points]] is called a [[converging lens]]
	- Inbound parallel rays arrive at the second focal point.
	- Diverging rays at the first focal point are passed outbound as parallel [[optical ray|optic rays]]
- The two focal lengths (again, [[range of validity|for a thin lens]], $f$ are always equal, even if the curvature is different for the [[thermal contact, material system junction, optical junction or adventure|junction]].
- $f$ is related to the [[index of refraction]] and both of the [[optical radius]].
- A [[positive lens]] has $f>0$.
