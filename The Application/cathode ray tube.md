#C27-2 

A [[measurement device]] and [[machine]] to provide [[human control]] of [[electrons]]. Also used in [[television]].

A bit like [[ion propulsion]]

#### The [[electrons]] gun
- In a near [[vacuum]] $\approx 10^{-8} \text{ atm}$
- Uses a [[heating coil]] [[filament]] possibly of [[tungsten]]
	- [[electrical current]] is passed through it, increases the [[temperature]] of cathode
	- This is called [[incandescent light bulbs|thermionic emission]], but a [[cold cathode]] can use a different process.
- Covered with a [[cathode]] a kind of [[electrical wire, or terminal]]
	- Electrons hover over the surface of the cathode
- A negative [[voltage, or electric potential|voltage]] shield called a [[control grid, velocity selector]], controls the intensity
	- Basically the [[current density]] of the stream
- Two anodes with a postive [[voltage, or electric potential|voltage]] 
	- One called a focusing, reduces the width of the stream
		- Like an [[optical lens]] composed of [[equipotential surfaces]].
	- One called an accelerating anode modulates the [[velocity]] varying the effectiveness of a [[magnetic field]] to
