#C23-2

A [[measurement device]] and [[electrical circuit element]] for the purpose of finding the [[voltage, or electric potential]] between two [[material system]] with a [[electrical potential energy]], or [[net charge]].

- [[resolution]] down to $10^{-12} \text{ V}$ can be attained
- Provides a method for measuring [[batteries]]

[[assume the maximum possible|Ideally]] acts as an open circuit, $R\rightarrow \infty$

Implemented with a [[d'Arsonval galvanometer]]
