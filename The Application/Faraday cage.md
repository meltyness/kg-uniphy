#C22-5 
This is a [[machine]] in [[communications]], [[electronic devices]], and [[health and safety]] to provide [[human control]] over the [[electric field]] in a [[space]].

It does so following from the principle that 
- [[in electrostatics the electric field at every point within the material of a conductor must be zero]]

And that since an external electric field will introduce no [[net charge]] inside the cage that the electric field inside will be everywhere zero, it simply will only act to cause [[material system charge polarization]].
