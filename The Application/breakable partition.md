#C19-3 

A [[build, or part|way]] to partition a [[container]], and enable [[free expansion|rapid, spontaneous]] [[volume]] change of a [[gas]], which can change the characteristics of the [[thermodynamic process, path]].

For [[ideal gas]] this results in no change in [[temperature]], but otherwise a slight decrease -- presumably as [[molecular collision]] causes [[molecular speeds]] to fall.

#WaitWhat is [[van der Waals equation]] conservative? #GotIt yeah it's got curl zero everywhere.
