#C29-2 

A type of [[machine]] or [[measurement device]] composed of a [[solenoid, and current loops]] in order to measure the magnitude of a [[magnetic field]] in a region where it is set up with a known direction.

By using the known number of turns, and quickly eliminating the flux, while masuring the current inside, we can use [[Faraday's law of induction]] to measure the field strength.

Supports [[communications]].
