#C18-E 
A #20thCentury [[machine]] of providing [[human control]] of the [[atomic speciation, nuclides, isotope]] for the purpose of [[energy storage and transmission]] and [[Atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]].

- Two [[container]] separated by a [[permeable barrier]] is filled with a [[material mixture]] of [[uranium]].
	- The difference in [[molecular speeds]] causes more of the undesirable [[atomic speciation, nuclides, isotope|species]], ${}^{238}\text{U}$ to remain in the high-pressure zone, based on the [[permeable barrier|precise characeristics of the permeable barrier]]
- A high [[pressure]] side and a low [[pressure]] side is maintained.
- A [[cascade]] is [[build, or part|built]] so that a sequence of phases operate on the main, high-pressure flow to ensure a [[precision, accuracy, uncertainty, and significant figures|precise]] [[concentration]] of ${}^{235}\text{U}$ is achieved
- #WaitWhat #ProofDeferred $\text{UF}_6$ is the only stable [[gas]] form of uranium?
