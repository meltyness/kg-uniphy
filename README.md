# Knowledge-graph, University Physics
`kg-uniphy` is an open-source physics book, in the form of an Obsidian vault.

Useful for brainstorming, tugging certain threads, rewalking the logic of physics.

If you have a phenomena in mind, and you think it is related to physics, simply start at Physics and walk towards that phenomenon.

## Basic application
There are many stub articles, but Obsidian, by default, provides the capability to trace backlinks in the right pane. So that all thus-far identified concepts (machines, phenomena, laws) which invoke a concept as related, can quickly be listed out.

Additionally, if you have loaded the map into Obsidian and allowed add-ons, you can press "Ctrl+P" type "path" and use the "Path Finder" facility to quickly brainstorm things[0] for example, how resonance is related to health and safety. Path finder is [an awesome Obsidian plug-in by jerrywcy available here](https://github.com/jerrywcy/obsidian-path-finder)
