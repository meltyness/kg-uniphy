### Definition
An [[experimental]] [[science]].

[[physicists]] [[observe|observable]] and [[describe outcomes]] of [[experiment or measurement]] of the [[phenomena of nature]] and try to find [[patterns]] or [[principles]] that relate them.

These patterns are called [[physical theories]] and when well-established and broadly used, [[physical laws and principles]], through the [[development of physical theories]].
