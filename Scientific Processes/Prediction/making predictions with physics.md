#C1-2

Making predictions with physics consists of the following steps:

- Identify the relevant concepts
	- What are the applicable [[physical laws and principles]]?
	- What are the target [[physical quantities]]?
- Set up the problem
	- Choose [[formula|formulas]]
	- Draw a sketch
- Execute the solution
	- List all known quantities
	- List all unknown quantities
	- Solve equations for the unknowns
- Evaluate your answer
	- Does this answer make sense? Is it immediately falsifiable?
	- Are the [[formula|formulas]] [[dimensionally consistent]]?
	- Revise
