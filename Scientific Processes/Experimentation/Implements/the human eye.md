#C34-6

Part of [[human limitations]] for dealing with [[optical image]] has the following [[optical surface properties of materials]]

- The crystalline lens has [[index of refraction]] $1.437$ #Plagiarism 
	- This is under [[human control]] via ciliary muscle which decreases the [[optical radius]]
	- When relaxed the focal length is at a maximum.
- The vitreous humor material has [[index of refraction]] $1.336$
- The retina is the biological [[photocell, and photomultiplier]]
	- Only a small portion of this has good [[resolution]], approximately $0.25 \text{ mm}$ diameter
- [[light intensity]] is [[occlude or filter]] by the iris, recalling that [[the geometry of the optical image is not effected by the partial occlusion of the optical components, only the intensity is]]
- The [[resolution]] is described in terms of [[angular size]].

#### Serviceability
- [[glasses]]
- [[LASIK]], or [[PRK]] which employ [[LASER, MASER stimulated light]] and [[pulsed lasers]]
