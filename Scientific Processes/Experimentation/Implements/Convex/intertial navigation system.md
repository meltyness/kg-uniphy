#C2-6 

### Discussion
An INS measures an aircraft's [[acceleration]] to derive the [[position]] and [[velocity]] using principles related to [[you can't feel velocity, but you can feel acceleration]], as well as [[kinematics#with Variable Acceleration]].

Given this information, and the initial [[position]] (say [[latitude and longitude]]) combined with [[global positioning system]]

### Claim
#### The human [[inner ear]] is an INS
Section #C4-3 claims that the inner ear is an inertial navigation system capable of measuring [[acceleration]] by principles in [[Newton's second law of motion]].
