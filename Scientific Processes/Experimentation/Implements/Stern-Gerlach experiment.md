#C41-3
Effects other than [[the Zeeman effect]] were observed under [[spectroscopy]].

#### [[phenomenology]]
- Experiments with [[emission spectra, absorption spectra and diffraction grating, spectroscopy|emission spectra]] produce lines that don't agree with theory, even in light of [[the Zeeman effect]].
- Due solely to the [[magnetic quantum number]], we only predict an odd number of lines.
- Instead this effect results in even number of components $(2j+1) \ \ \ \ (j = {\frac{1}{2}, \frac{3}{2}},\dots)$.
- ... and an associated [[particle spin quantum number]] [[magnetic dipole]] [[magnetic moment]], $$S_z = \pm {\hbar \over 2}=\hbar m_s$$
- [[quantum electrodynamics]] predicts this effect more accurately.
