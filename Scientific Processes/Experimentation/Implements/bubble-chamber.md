#C27-4 

A [[build, or part]] of [[experiment or measurement|experimental]] [[measurement device]] composed of [[fluid]] [[hydrogen]] for understanding [[subatomic particle]] [[motion]].

For the spiral pattern observed [[subatomic particle collisions]], between the [[bubble-chamber substrate]] and the incident [[subatomic particle]] must lower the 
- [[kinetic energy]], 
- [[speed]], 
- magnitude of [[momentum]].

Confirms the existence of a [[positron]]
