#C17-3

- A constant-[[volume]] [[thermometer]] uses the following:
	- The [[pressure]] of a [[gas]] increases with [[temperature]]. 
	- [[the pressure of a gas increases with temperature]]

Using this principle and [[simply fit a relationship]] for several different [[kind of material|kinds of gases]], it was found that there is an apparent [[absolute zero]].

The [[precision, accuracy, uncertainty, and significant figures|precision]] of a larger, lower-pressure [[measurement device|instrument]] comes at the cost of being slow to reach [[equilibrium]].
