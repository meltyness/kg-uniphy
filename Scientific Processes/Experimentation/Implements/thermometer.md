#C17-1 

A thermomete is a [[measurement device]] for measuring [[temperature]] that uses [[ethanol]] or [[mercury]] or another [[opaque]] [[kind of material]] to convert the [[pressure]] due to [[temperature]] into a [[length]].

Another method would use the [[electrical conductivity, and resistivity#resistivity and temperature|thermal effect on resistivity of a material]].

You place these into [[thermal contact, material system junction, optical junction or adventure|thermal contact]] with the target [[material]], such as a [[container]] with the thermometer, and once it has reached [[thermal equilibrium]] and then [[experiment or measurement|take a reading]].

One can also use a [[bimetallic strip]].

Another type of thermometer is called a [[gas thermometer]]
