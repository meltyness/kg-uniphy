#C34-5 

A [[machine]] and [[optical instrument]] composed of the following parts:

- The [[optics]]
	- Two [[optical lens]], under [[human control]] to control the [[focal point, and focal length]], the other of which provides [[human control]] of the [[extended object]] representing the scene in [[space]]
	- A diaphragm to control the [[light intensity]]
		- A short $f$ on the zoom lens leads to a greater [[light intensity]], recalling that [[the geometry of the optical image is not effected by the partial occlusion of the optical components, only the intensity is]], we can vary this with the diaphragm.
	- Accounting to provide [[human control]] over [[aberration]] to include [[chromatic aberration]]
- A shutter to [[occlude or filter]] when the camera is not in operation
	- Additionally it only opens for a [[duration]] under [[human control]], the [[exposure]].
- [[optical focus]] implies that the [[real image]] aligns with the [[charge-coupled device]] or [[imaging film]]
