#C39-2

A [[measurement device]] for the [[diffraction of material entities]], similar to [[x-ray crystallography]]. Originally intended to [[experiment or measurement|measure]] the [[optical surface properties of materials]] of [[nickel]].

Discovered at [[Bell Labs]] in the #20thCentury 

#### [[phenomenology]]
- A [[cathode ray tube]] acts as a source of [[electrons]] acclerated by a known [[voltage, or electric potential]].
- A [[specimen]] of [[nickel]] undergoes the [[electromagnetic interaction]]
	- Depending on [[material phase]], [[nickel]] may be [[polycrystalline]]
	- The sample was subjected to [[polishing]] with the [[hypotheses]] that it would undergo [[diffuse reflection]].
- A [[vacuum]]-related resulted in an [[oxide layer]] [[disaster]], and the ensuing triage resulted in a [[material phase change]] and the sample was [[recrystallized]] in the [[region of interest]].
- They recognized the shape of the [[results]] and [[describe outcomes]] to look like [[x-ray crystallography]], or [[diffraction of material entities]], and associated it with [[rough timeline of quantum mechanics|the de Broglie hypothesis]].
- The following [[derivation]] steps
	- The energy on the electron		
		- An analysis using $v=E/B$ from the velocity selector 
			- #WaitWhat why is this wrong? is this wrong?
		- The [[work]] from the [[electrical potential energy]], gives [[kinetic energy]], $K=eV=p^2 /2m_e$
	- the [[de Broglie wavelength]] with $\lambda=h / mv$ #Caution $\text{energy} \ne \text{electric field}$
- Finally gives $$\lambda = {h \over p} = {h \over \sqrt{2m_eeV}}$$
- And we [[describe outcomes|conclude]] then, that [[material particles exhibit wave-like behaviors]]
