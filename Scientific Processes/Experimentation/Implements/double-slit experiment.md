#C35-2

Performed by [[Thomas Young]] circa #19thCentury demonstrates [[interference of light waves]].

#### [[phenomenology]]
- A source of [[monochromatic]] [[electromagnetic waves and light#as a plane wave step wave|plane waves]] from a [[light emission]] illuminates a single [[occlude or filter|barrier]] with a narrow slit.
- From the slit emerge #Caution cylindrical wave fronts
	- presumably this follows from [[Huygen's principle]], since it is an [[extended object]]-shaped source at that point.
	- this defines the [[range of validity]]
	- additionally a [[LASER, MASER stimulated light]] can be used to produce this disturbance.
- From this the waves of light hit two slits on a plane,  two [[coherent waves]] emerge and are [[incident]] on a [[screen]]

#### ... [[formula]] [[derivation]]
 - Two waves of light emerging from a plane a distance $d$ from eachother, and a distance $R$ from  emerge #Caution [[range of validity]] is contingent on the [[approximating specific complications|assumption]] that the slits are very small, for a more detailed analysis see [[diffraction of light waves]]
	- Following from [[interference of light waves]] along the flat surface of the [[screen]] the relations for constructive and destructive interference hold in $r_1, r_2$ the distance from the center of the second slits
	- Taking $\theta$ as then angle of a ray off the [[material surface normal]] of the wave source plane.

Examining the system geometrically, and [[approximating specific complications|assuming]] $R>>d$, the distance becomes$$r_2-r_1=d\sin\theta$$
This can also be used as a [[measurement device]] for [[electromagnetic spectrum, frequency of light]], with further [[approximating specific complications|claims]] from [[interference of light waves]] we arrive at $$y_m = R\tan\theta_m \approx R\sin\theta_m= R{m\lambda \over d}$$
#### ... in terms of [[light intensity]]
#C35-3
- We take account at $P$ in the pattern of the phase difference between the arriving waves due to the path difference, $r_2-r_1$, and 
	- recalling from [[Poynting vector]] that $I = \frac{1}{2}\epsilon_0cE_\text{max}^2$
	- assume also that the arriving light has the same [[electromagnetic wave polarization]], 
	- and that the [[dampened oscillation]] is negligible [[range of validity]], consider [[eddy current]]
- So capturing this, $$E_1=E\cos(\omega t+\phi), \ \text{and \ } E_2=E\cos(\omega t)$$
- These relations form a [[phasor]] which gives $$E_P = 2E\bigg|\cos{\phi\over2}\bigg| \implies I =2\epsilon_0cE^2\cos^2\frac{\phi}{2}$$
- And accounting for the paths $$\phi=\frac{2\pi}{\lambda}(r_2-r_1)$$
- And predicting the pattern on the screen is then $$I=2\epsilon_0cE^2\cos^2\bigg({d\pi y \over \lambda R}\bigg)$$
- Another [[range of validity]] concern regarding [[dampened oscillation]] appears here for the fall off.
