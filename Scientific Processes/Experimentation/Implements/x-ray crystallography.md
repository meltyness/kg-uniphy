#C36-6

When [[electromagnetic waves and light]] with [[wavelength]] comparable to the [[molecular radius]] and [[molecular geometry]] given [[displacement]] of [[intermolecular and interatomic forces]] and [[van der Waals interaction]] are shone and displayed on a [[screen]], then [[diffraction of light waves]] takes place.

#### [[phenomenology]]
- Light incident to a [[crystal]] of a [[kind of material]] undergoes [[Rayleigh scattering]]
	- Note this implies that it is *not* subject to [[law of specular reflection]], and instead the $\theta_a = \theta_r$ is measured from the plane -- not the normal.
	- This occurs at each subsequent layer of [[atom]].
	- Some incident [[optical ray]] scatter such that 
		- row atoms at a distance, $a$, must have $a\cos\theta_a=a\cos\theta_r$ to produce the maximum of constructive interference.
		- column atoms at a distance, $d$, must meet the [[Bragg condition]] to produce the maximum of constructive interference $$2d\sin\theta=m\lambda$$
	- this puts a strong bound on $\lambda$ in relation to $d$.
- Another consideration is that for the [[bound states]] [[electron energy level]], those that are in smaller [[electron shell level, or orbit]] such as in [[hydrogen]] are less interactive than those in larger [[atom]] like [[mercury]] or [[gold]].


#### Applications
- The discovery of the structure of [[DNA, cancer, genetic senescence]]
