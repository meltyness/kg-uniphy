#C16-8 

[[measurement device]] used in [[celestial mechanics]]. 

- Can determine [[relative velocity]], make measurements of [[binary gravitational system]] by applying [[Doppler effect for electromagnetic waves]].
- Using [[Stefan-Boltzmann law]] measurements of [[heat]] and [[temperature]], we can determine [[length]] of [[stars]].
- [Cassegrain reflector - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassegrain_reflector)
	- [[cascade]] of [[optical mirror]] configured using that principle that [[the geometry of the optical image is not effected by the partial occlusion of the optical components, only the intensity is]].
