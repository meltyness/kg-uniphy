#C23-E 

A [[machine]] that serves as a [[measurement device]] for determining if [[electronic configuration, and ionization|ionizing]] [[heat radiation and absorption, thermal radiation|radiation]] is present in [[space]].

It does so by assuming that 
- [[alpha particles]]
- [[electromagnetic waves and light]]

have sufficient [[total electrical energy]] to cause the ionization.
