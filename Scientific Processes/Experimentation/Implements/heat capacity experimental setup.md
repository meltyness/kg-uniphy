#C17-5 
A [[measurement device]] for [[heat capacity and specific heat]],

A more modern approach than the [[archaic]] [[Joule-Thomson Effect]] with a crank or a weight would be to use a [[heating coil]] and [[electromagnetic interaction]] to [[energy transformation and heat flow]] into a [[specimen]] of a [[kind of material]], and [[experiment or measurement|measure]] the [[temperature]] change with a [[thermometer]].
