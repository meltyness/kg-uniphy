#C38-2
As opposed to [[emission|thermionic emission]], this varies with the [[electromagnetic spectrum, frequency of light]] of the [[incident]] light. 

The [[formula]] for operation is like $$eV_0=hf-\phi$$
where $\phi$ is the work function of the material surface.

#### [[phenomenology]]
- When a [[photon]] strikes a [[electrical conductivity, and resistivity|conductor]] some [[electrons]] near the [[optical surface properties of materials|surface]] [[escape]] into the [[vacuum]]. 
- A [[work]] [[formula|function]] describes how much energy needs to be absorbed to escape an [[electrons]].
- Two [[electrical wire, or terminal]] one with [[incident]] light.
	- The incident [[cathode]] loses [[electrons]], and an [[electromotive force, and ideal voltage source|emf]] maintains [[electrical current]] while a [[d'Arsonval galvanometer]] inline as an [[ammeter]] measures the flow.
- Photoelectrons are drawn towards the anode, in the [[vacuum]] to prevent [[subatomic particle collisions]].
- When [[monochromatic]] [[electromagnetic waves and light]] are incident, a [[logical|minimum]] frequency must tbe superceded, called the "threshold frequency"
	- $I\propto \text{ intensity}$ for a given [[light intensity]].
- This effect itself produces current flow which can only be stopped by reversing the current flow to a pinchoff called the "stopping [[voltage, or electric potential|potential]]"
	- $V_0 \propto f$
