A [[measurement device]] for [[thermodynamic state]].

Using a known:
- [[Bourdon pressure gauge]]
- [[container]] of known [[volume]]
- [[thermometer]]
- [[kind of material]]

we can determine the [[amount of a material]] contained for a [[gas]].

With excess [[temperature]], may be implicit in an [[explosion]]
