A [[measurement device]] for the very small, further overcoming [[the human eye]], two [[optical lens]] can be combined.

An eyepiece lens, and an [[extended object|objective]] lens.

The objective lens produces a [[real image]] *inside* the [[focal point, and focal length|focal length]] of the eyepiece, which implies that the eyepiece lens then creates an [[optically inverted]] [[virtual image]] with [[optical magnification]].

Again the [[angular size]] will be of primary concern
