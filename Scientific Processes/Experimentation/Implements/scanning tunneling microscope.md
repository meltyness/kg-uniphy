#C18-2 

A [[measurement device]] for measuring [[molecular geometry]] through a [[specimen]] of a [[material system]].

Uses [[human control]] of the [[displacement]] from a fine tipped [[electrical wire, or terminal|terminal]] and sensed [[electrical current]] due to [[quantum tunneling]] to measure the [[optical surface properties of materials]].
