#C35-5

A #19thCentury [[machine]] and [[measurement device]] which uses [[coherent waves]] through a [[beam splitter]] to measure to within a [[wavelength]] of an [[electromagnetic waves and light]] the [[displacement]] of the mirrors, an [[analogy]] can be formed to the [[double-slit experiment]].

#### ... [[phenomenology]]
- [[monochromatic]] [[optical ray]] is formed towards a [[beam splitter]]
- Two rays emergy and travel to an [[optical mirror]] at $90^\circ$ to one another
	- Since the [[beam splitter]] has some thickness, a [[compensator plate]] is placed to ensure that they remain [[coherent waves]].
- When $\ell_1 = \ell_2, \phi_{\text{M}_2 \rightarrow \text{M}_1}=90^\circ$ the waves arrive constructively at the observer
	- A "[[bullseye]]" pattern is observed at the edges due to the effect on $r_1, r_2$ [[optical ray]] lengths of being deflected at $A$, from the source, or by misalignment of the free [[optical mirror]], $\text{M}_2$.
- Recalling from the discourse of the [[interference of light waves]], $$r_2-r_1=m\lambda$$
- and considering the [[fringe density]], and $r_2-r_1 \approx 2\ell$, and taking a [[differential equation, or principle]], #ProofDeferred #WaitWhat  $$d\ell = {\lambda\  dm \over 2}$$
- From this experiment follows the result that [[the speed of light is the same in all reference frames]], and [[Einstein's special theory of relativity]].
