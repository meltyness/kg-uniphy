The process by which [[physical laws and principles]] are [[models|assumed]] and interrogated [[logical|logically]] -- resulting in [[hypotheses]] for experimentation.

#### Observed Techniques
- Take limits and find nomenclature.
- [[take cases]]
- Move up or down the ladder of rate of change by taking derivatives or integrals.
- Maintain [[dimensionally consistent]] [[physical quantities]].
- Utilize [[kinematics along a straight line#with Variable Acceleration|the most general-known sense]] to acquire more generality.
- [[priming the variable to use the upper limit]]
- [[the appearance of a constant implies state]]
