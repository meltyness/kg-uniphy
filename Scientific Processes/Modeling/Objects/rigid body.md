#KeyConcept

#### Definition
A rigid body has a [[definite size and a definite shape]].

A rigid body is not [[deformation and elasticity]]

[[every possible motion of a rigid body can be represented as a combination of translational motion of the center of mass and rotation about an axis through the center of mass]]

#### [[center of mass]] [[formula]]
For $i$ particles with masses $m_i$ each positioned at $\vec{r}_i$ the center of mass is:
$$\vec{r}_{cm} = {\sum_i{m_i\vec{r}_i} \over\sum_i m_i}$$
For homogenous materials with a geometric center, the center of mass corresponds. For [[axis symmetric]] objects, the center of mass is along the axis.

#### [[center of gravity]]
When considering [[equilibrium]] conditions of rigid bodies, the objects [[weight]] is distributed over the space it fills. We can aproximate this by assuming that its centered at a specific point. In the absence of [[tidal forces]], then the center of gravity is the same as the center of mass.
