#C15-4

The ideal string [[wave medium]] has the following properties:

- $F$ [[equilibrium]] [[tension force|tension]].
- $\mu$ [[mass]] [[mass density]].
- Perfect flexibility, $\Delta m = \mu \Delta x$

under any [[transverse wave|transverse]] force, [[impulse-momentum theorem]] gives
$$ {F_y \over F} = {v_y \over v} = {\partial y \over \partial x}$$

#### [[derivation]] and [[formula]]
So, it's a bit hard to explain. This is a mixture of:

- a constraint
- an unusual, or hard to represent assumption about the string
- a [[thermodynamic state]]-transition, from [[Consider only the initial state|imparting]] the [[oscillatory kinematics|oscillation]] to uninterrupted oscillation, for which [[construct a description that simplifies explanation but doesn't depend on any details]] about the [[force]] itself.

So when imparting vertical [[momentum]] to the string, impulse-momentum gives $$F_yt=mv_y$$which implies that during this motion, each segment of string has the same velocity, and only more of the string gets involved.

Each bit has different departure time, but the same velocity -- it's easy to see that the string will have $\partial y / \partial x$ everywhere the same.

What's less clear is that the components of impulse and components of momentum may be [[superposition of forces|superposed]], and baked into this is the assumption that perfectly-[[tensile-compressive stress|elastic]], horizontal, intra-string [[elastic collision|collisions]] [[law of conservation of momentum|conserve momentum]], and by impulse-momentum applied to the horizontal portion (which is only moving [[generalized coordinates|virtually]]), triangle similarity, owing to the superposition vacuum we've drawn around the situation gives: $${F_y \over T} = {v_y t \over v_xt}$$
which gives simple algebraic path to $${F_y \over T} ={\partial y / \partial t \over\partial x / \partial t}={\partial y \over \partial x}$$
