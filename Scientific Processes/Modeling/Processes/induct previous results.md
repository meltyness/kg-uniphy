Or in the [[development of physical theories]]
- [[Newton's laws of motion]] has a huge [[range of validity]]
- [[equilibrium]]
- [[law of conservation of energy]] has a huge [[range of validity]]
- ...
- Perhaps some future concept like [[task]] or [[allotropy]] has a huge [[range of validity]]

[[energy]] appears (lost, missing, can't find, impossible)
-> [[conservation]] applies to a *new [[abstract negligible facets|form]]*
