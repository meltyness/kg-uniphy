#C22-1 

Since many problems are spherically, or axially symmetric, we can use [[flux]] and always-simplifying geometry in order to solve the problem with the least steps.

The elements of this are as follows:
- put the [[abstract negligible facets|system]] through some transformation
- [[employ deductive reasoning|confirm]] that the [[physical quantities]] of the system do not [[differential equation, or principle|change]]
