For example we can take a complication like 
- $\sin \theta$ disappear in [[pendulums]] by using the fact that $\sin\theta \approx \theta$ or using the [binomial theorem taylor series approximations](obsidian://open?vault=Calculus%20Review&file=Discrete%20Calculus%2FFamilies%20of%20Taylor%20Series%2FBinomial%20function%20as%20its%20Taylor%20Series%20Expansion) and 
- eliminating all but the first two terms to approximate [[van der Waals interaction]] as a [[Hooke's law]]-style [[restoring force]]
- [[Doppler effect for electromagnetic waves]] can be approximated taking $v << c$

These types of steps form the gateway to [[correspondence principle, and perturbation theory]].
