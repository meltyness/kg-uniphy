#C22-3 

[[the flux through a sphere is independent of the radius]] combined with [[shadow puppetry]] to understand the relationship between $dA_\text{sphere}$ and $dA_\text{potato}$

We relate the potato to a sum of arbitrary differentially-smaller spheres -- with better understood guarantees regarding the metric relationship, comparing normals.
