Once it is realized that, for example

- [[escape speed]], and a universal [[speed limit]] such as the [[speed of light]]
	- imply that it's possible for so much gravity to exist that not even [[electromagnetic waves and light]] can reach escape speed, one can theorize about objects such as [[black hole]]
- [[reversibility]] and [[Efficiency]]
	- or [[the Carnot cycle]].
