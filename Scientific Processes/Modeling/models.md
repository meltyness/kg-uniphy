#C1-2

### Definition
A simplified version of a [[phenomena of nature]] for the purpose of managing [[making predictions with physics|predictions]].

Also known as an "idealized model"

- [[phenomenology]]
	- [[after operating on a complete phenomenological picture]]
- [[synthesis]]
	- [[synthesizes a very generic, correct statement regarding a number of disparate observations]]

### Discussion
Utilize [[physical quantities]] related to a [[standard systems of units]].

### Techniques and Objects
- [[abstract negligible facets]]
- beg the question: [[what can be measured]]
	- [[select a coordinate system that eliminates the most variables]]
	- [[exploit the symmetry of a problem]]
	- [[invert the sense of common questions]]
	- [[it won't always be immediately obviously which rate a phenomena effects]]
- [[up front, identify which intuition is being violated]]
- [[simply fit a relationship]]
- [[classify a type of relationship]]
- [[induct previous results]]
- Use [[analogy]]
- [[luck out on a set of compensating errors]]
- [[constantly make an educated guess about the sign or direction]]
- [[approximating specific complications]]
- [[construct a description that simplifies explanation but doesn't depend on any details]]
- [[establish a test volume or area]]
- [[minimize the number of degrees of freedom in defining a physical quantity]]
- [[form an equitropic joint-union]]
- [[assume common, reasonable system geometry]]
- [[enumerate all apparently permissible configurations]]

- [[potato extension technique]], [[shadow puppetry]]
- [[break down the kinds of behavior into a well-characterized component]]
- [[are formal and support the argument based solely on the key principles]]
- [[using statistical techniques to describe oscillatory phenomena]]
- [[abuse statistical techniques]]
- [[take a well-known general relationship, and extend it to a simpler case]]
