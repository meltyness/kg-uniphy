"incorporate novel reference frames as a metric" -- article renamed

In the chapter 5 exercises investigating:

- [[wedge motion]]
- [[Double Atwood's Machine]]

Beyond correctly applying [[Newton's laws of motion]], [[physicists]] must use two principles not explicitly discussed:

- [[kinematics can be taken relative to acceleration, even though Newton's laws cannot]]
- [[if you can measure distance, you can measure velocity and acceleration]]
- [[that ideal ropes must have the same acceleration is a manifestation of the fact that the length doesn't change]]
- Objects can have [[definite size and a definite shape]]
- [[density]]
- [[amount of a material]]
- [[what is the shape of the probability density]]
