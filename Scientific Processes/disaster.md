#C1-2 

A disaster is an [[models|unexpected]] [[results|result]]. When [[physical systems]] falls outside of the parameters of [[human control]]. The primary objective of [[reliability engineering]] is to prevent this.

Typically with important implications in [[physical laws and principles]] or possibly [[health and safety]].

#### Real-world
- [[Tacoma Narrow's Bridge Collapse]]
- [[trainwreck]]
- [[car accident]]
- [[tsunami]]
- [[Atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]]
- [[The Great Mollasses Flood]]
- [[The Dublin Whiskey Fire]]

#### Theoretical
There's always a faulty assumption, somewhere.
- [[circular logic]]
- [[clearly going off a cliff]] -- when you have square or triangular oscillation in a physical description, something likely may have gone wrong.
- [[deciding there must be no cliff]] -- also a problem
- [[assuming zero doesn't exist]]
- [[Blackbody Radiation Disaster]]
- [[assuming everything is continuous]]
- [[assuming all numbers are integers]]
- [[assuming all numbers are fractions]]
- [[assuming all numbers are real]]
- [[assuming that any system of mathematics can prove all statement]]
