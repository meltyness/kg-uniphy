#### deprivileging an actor in [[explanation]]
- [[earth is a planet]]
- [[all planets orbit the sun]]
- [[assuming zero doesn't exist]]
- [[law of total internal reflection]] 

#### significant divergence in [[physical quantities]] under simple [[human control]]
- [[metals are generally better conductors]]
- [[electrical conductivity, and resistivity#conductivity in electrical current]]
- [[semiconductors]] behave [[tropographic]] responsive to [[electric field]]

#### [[design experiments]] that produce [[disaster]]
- [[Milliken oil drops]] produce [[elementary charge]]
- [[Hans Christian Ã˜rsted|Orsted experiment]] [[electromagnetic interaction]]
- multiple measurements of attainable temperature converge to an [[absolute zero]] as in the [[kelvin]] scale and [[Charles's law]] through multiple experiments.
- [[dropped object from the Leaning Tower of Pisa]] shows that the [[duration]] is independent of [[weight]]

#### identifying an unproven [[hypotheses]]
- [[black hole]] as described by crossing [[escape speed]] with [[speed of light]] as a [[speed limit]]
- [[relative velocity]] as described by crossing the [[speed of light]] as a speed limit
- [[the Carnot cycle]]

#### Typical syndrome
- A sharper [[range of validity]] for the old theory is identified.
