In the #20thCentury a hidden idea was discarded that all [[physical quantities]] must be continuous. 

- [[Niehls Bohr]], [[Max Karl Ernst Ludwig Planck]], [[Albert Einstein]]

And experiments such as [[double-slit experiment]], [[photoelectric effect]], demonstrating the [[duality]] between 
- [[electromagnetic waves and light]]
- [[optical ray]] and [[optics]]

And [[identify sound theories producing incorrect prediction]] such as [[Blackbody Radiation Disaster]].

[[Lois-Victor de Broglie]] in a [[hypotheses]] leap that [[assume the maximum possible]] took that because [[electromagnetic waves and light]] presented a [[duality]] (in that [[photon#... diffraction of light waves and elementary particle duality|photons exhibit diffraction]]) that the same [[duality]] must exist for [[material]] [[subatomic particle]].

Next the [[Davisson-Germer apparatus]] was employed in a way that demonstrated [[diffraction of material entities]].

[[Max Born]] describes the [[quantum kinematics]] interpretation of the [[wavefunction]].
