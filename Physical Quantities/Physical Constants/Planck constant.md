#C28-8 

A [[physical quantities]] representing the smallest [[work]] that can be done on a [[subatomic particle]]. Named for #20thCentury, [[Max Karl Ernst Ludwig Planck]].

$$h = 4.137\times10^{-15} \text{ eV s} = 6.626\times 10^{-34} \text{ J s}$$
Also there's a reduced constant, 
$$\hbar = h/2\pi$$
