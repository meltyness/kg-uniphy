#C2-5 

### Definition
When the [[the acceleration of a falling body is independent of its weight|flat-earth model]] is applicable, take $g=9.8 \ {\text{m} / \text{s}^2}$ and apply [[kinematics#with Constant Acceleration|kinematics with constant acceleration]].

More broadly a result of [[Newton's law of gravitation]].

### Variability
$\vec{g}$ is taken around $9.80 \ \text{m} / \text{s}^2$ however it varies across the [[earth, atmosphere, water, and wildlife]]'s surface between $9.78 - 9.82$.

[[NIST]] [gives "standard acceleration of gravity"](https://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Value?gn) $\text{9.80665 m/s}^2$
