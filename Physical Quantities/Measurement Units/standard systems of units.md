### Definition
When [[experiment or measurement|measuring]] [[physical quantities]], this is always used.

[[SI units]] is has been used since the 1960s.

A key process for converting between units is [[dimensional analysis]], and all [[formula|formulas]] must be [[dimensionally consistent]].

### Prefixes
$\text{nano } \{x\} = \text{n}x = 10^{-9} \{ x \}$
$\text{micro } \{x\} = \mu x = 10^{-6} \{ x \}$
$\text{milli } \{x\} = \text{m}x = 10^{-3} \{ x \}$
$\text{centi } \{x\} = \text{c}x = 10^-2 \{ x \}$
$\text{kilo } \{x\} = \text{k}x = 10^3 \{ x \}$

### [[Imperial]]
We'll just use SI.
