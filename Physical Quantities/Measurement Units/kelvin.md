#C16-2 

The [[SI units]] for [[temperature]], related to [[celsius]] with $$0 \ K = -273.15^\circ C$$
Named for [[William Thomson, Lord Kelvin]].

And [[room temperature]] is $293.15 K$

There exists an [[operational definition of physical quantities|operational definition]] through [[Charles's law]] which holds for the kelvin scale while using the [[triple point of water]] and this process moving from [[celsius]] acts to [[minimize the number of degrees of freedom in defining a physical quantity]] ... this is an [[absolute temperature]]

$$T = T_\text{triple} {p \over p_\text{triple}}=(273.16 \text{ K}){p \over p_\text{triple}}$$
