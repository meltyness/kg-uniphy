#C27-2 
Named for [[Nikola Tesla]]
$$\text{1 tesla = 1 T = 1 } {\text{N} \over \text{A m}}$$

Checking that this is [[dimensionally consistent]] with [[Ã˜rsted-Laplace-Thomson law]], 

$$F = qvB = [\text{C}{\text{m} \over \text{s}} {\text{N} \over {\text{A m}}}]$$
${\text{C}/\text{A}} \implies \text{s}$ gives $\text{Nms/ms}$ so, $$\therefore F=[N]$$
Which means that the tesla is the correct unit for the [[magnetic field]].

The [[gauss]] is a related unit with $\text{1 G = 10}^{-4} \text{ T}$
