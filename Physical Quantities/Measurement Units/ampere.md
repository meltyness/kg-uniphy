#C25-1 

The ampere is the amount of [[electric charge]] to [[flux]] past a point per unit [[duration]]. It has units of [[coulomb]] per [[second]]. $$1 \ {\text{ C} \over \text{ s}}$$
Named for [[Andre Marie Ampere]]

This has an [[operational definition of physical quantities]] from [[SI units]] as follows: 

> One ampere is the current that, if present in each of two large parallel conductors 1 meter apart experience a force of $2\times 10^{-7} \text{ N/m}$
