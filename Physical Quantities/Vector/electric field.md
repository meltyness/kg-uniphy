> [[The electric force on a charged body is exerted by the electric field created by other charged bodies]]

So that a charge $q$ produces an $\vec{E}$ field like this, by [[cancelling out a member of the pair in an action-reaction pair]]. this also serves as a [[test charge]] and an [[operational definition of physical quantities|operational definition]] so that the field forms a [[physical quantities]] and [[vector quantity]] with [[SI units]].
$$\vec{E} = {\vec{F_0} \over q_0} \ \ \propto \ \ \bigg\{{\text{N} \over \text{C}},{\text{V} \over \text{m}}\bigg\}$$
$$\vec{E} = \lim_{q_0 \rightarrow 0} {\vec{F}_0 \over q_0}$$
... and in a complete definition, the [[vector field]] has [[formula]], $$\vec{E} = {1 \over 4\pi\epsilon_0}{q \over r^2}\hat{r}$$
The [[force]] felt by a particle in an electric field is with $q\vec{E}$.

#### ... [[superposition of fields]]
This applies with the relationship $$\vec{E} = \sum\vec{E}_i$$

#### ... as [[electric field lines]]
Similar to [[flow lines]], starting positive, terminating negative

#### ... in terms of [[voltage, or electric potential]]
When used in potential calculation we arrive at voltage, without respect to the other participant, truly treating potential as a property of the field. [[separating an actor from an action-reaction pair]]
