The [[temperature]] [[differential equation, or principle|gradient]] is a [[physical quantities]] for a pair of [[material system]] in [[thermal contact, material system junction, optical junction or adventure|thermal contact]],  $$T_H - T_C \over L$$
...or as it appears as a [[vector quantity]] in [[Fourier's law of thermal conduction]], $$\nabla T$$
