### Description
A [[vector quantity|vector]] [[physical quantities|quantity]] describing [[motion]].

[[the velocity is the average change in position over a small time window]]

### Units
Typically measured in [[meters]] per [[second]].

### [[formula]]
#### Average
In the case of simple motion, where $x$ represents the $x$-component of [[displacement]], the average velocity is given like: $$\bar{v}_x = {\Delta x \over \Delta t} = {x_2 - x_1 \over t_2 - t_1}$$Represents the average of the $x$-component of velocity, as measured through a single, specific [[time#Interval|interval]].

#### Instantaneous
In the case where where were [[describe outcomes]] of motion along a [[path]], where we can make [[experiment or measurement|measurement]] of [[displacement]] at near [[time#Instant|instant]] intervals, $$v_x = \lim_{\Delta t \rightarrow 0}{\Delta x \over \Delta t} = {dx \over dt}$$
#### Vector Form
$$\vec{r} = x \hat{i} + y \hat{j} + z \hat{k}$$
During a [[time#Interval|duration]] $\Delta t$, we find that the position changes like the following [[vector quantity]]: $$\Delta \vec{r} = \vec{r}_2 -\vec{r}_1= (x_2-x_1)\hat{i}+(y_2-y_1)\hat{j}+(z_2-z_1)\hat{k}$$ to that, we can also find $$\vec{v}_{av} = {\Delta \vec{r} \over \Delta t}$$
...and in the most general form, $$\vec{v}=\lim_{\Delta t \rightarrow 0}{\Delta \vec{r} \over \Delta t}={d \vec{r} \over dt}$$ and based on this definition, $$\vec{v} = <{dx \over dt}, {dy \over dt}, {dz
\over dt}>$$
Note that given $\vec{v}=\sqrt{v_x^2+v_y^2+v_z^2}$ is [[the velocity is tangent to the path of a particle at all points|tangent]] to $\vec{r}$ at all points.

[[speed]] is $\| \vec{v} \|$, the direction of travel is $$\alpha = \tan^{-1}{v_y \over v_x}$$
When velocity vector changes, there must be [[acceleration]]
