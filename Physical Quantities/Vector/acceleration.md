### Description
A [[vector quantity]] that describes the change in [[velocity]] over [[time]].

[[you can't feel velocity, but you can feel acceleration]]

### Units
Measured in [[meters]] per [[second]]$^2$
$$a_x \ \  \tilde{} \ \  {\text{m} \over \text{s}^2}$$

### [[formula]]
#### Average acceleration
In the case of simple motion, where $v_x$ represents the $x$-component of [[velocity#Instantaneous]], the average acceleration is given like: $$\bar{a}_x = {\Delta v \over \Delta t} = {v_{2x} - v_{1x} \over t_2 - t_1}$$Represents the average of the $x$-component of acceleration, as measured through a single, specific [[time#Interval|interval]].

#### Instantaneous acceleration
In the case where we [[experiment or measurement|observe]] motion along a [[path]], where we can make [[experiment or measurement|measurement]] of [[velocity]] at near [[time#Instant|instant]] intervals, $$a_x = \lim_{\Delta t \rightarrow 0}{\Delta v_x \over \Delta t} = {dv_x \over dt}$$
#### As a [[vector quantity]]
$$\vec{r} = v_x \hat{i} + v_y \hat{j} + v_z \hat{k}$$
During a [[time#Interval|duration]] $\Delta t$, we find that the [[velocity]] changes like the following [[vector quantity]]: $$\Delta \vec{r} = \vec{v}_2 -\vec{v}_1$$ to that, we can also find $$\vec{a}_{av} = {\Delta \vec{v} \over \Delta t}$$
...and in the most general form, $$\vec{v}=\lim_{\Delta t \rightarrow 0}{\Delta \vec{v} \over \Delta t}={d \vec{v} \over dt}$$ and based on this definition, $$\vec{a} = <{dv_x \over dt}, {dv_y \over dt}, {dv_z \over dt}>$$
#### Parallel and Perpendicular Components
Consider $\vec{a}$ in terms of a particle's direction of travel $\hat{v}$

- $a_{||}$ or $a_T$ tells us about changes in the particle's speed
- $a_{\perp}$ or $a_N$ tells us about changes in the particle's direction.

Acceleration is given by $\vec{a} = \vec{v}' = \vec{r}''$ and can be resolved into tangential and normal components with the following [[formula]]:
$$\vec{a} = a_T\vec{T}+a_N\vec{N}= v'\vec{T}+\kappa v^2\vec{N} $$
