### Definition
Power is a [[physical quantities]] relates [[work]] done over [[time]].

#### [[formula]]
The average power over an [[time#Interval|interval]] is given:
$$P_{av} = {\Delta W \over \Delta t}$$ and so it follows that instantaneous power is$$P = \lim_{\Delta t \rightarrow 0}P_{av}=\lim_{\Delta t \rightarrow 0}{\Delta W \over \Delta t}= {dW \over dt}$$
We can also write $\Delta W = F_{||} \Delta s$ in terms of [[displacement]].

Additionally, we have the relationship that $$P=\vec{F}\cdot\vec{v}$$
#### Discussion of Units
The [[SI units]] of power are the [[watt]]

The [[Imperial]] units are with $\text{1 hp = 550 ft · lb/s = 33,000 ft · lb/min}$
And we have $$\text{1 hp = 746 W = 0.746 kW}$$
This implies that $\text{kW·h}$ is a unit of [[energy]], not of power.
