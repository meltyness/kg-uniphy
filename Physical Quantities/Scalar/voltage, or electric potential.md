Potential is a [[scalar quantity]] [[electrical potential energy]] per unit [[electric charge]]. Voltage is a [[physical quantities]] that can be measured with a [[voltmeter]]$$V={U \over q_0}$$
The [[SI units]] are called the [[volt]]

#### ... [[formula]]
In general for a collection of [[electric charge|charged]] [[particle|particles]], $$V={1\over 4\pi\epsilon_0} \int{dq \over r}$$
We also have that $$V_a-V_b=\int_a^b\vec{E}\cdot d\vec{l}$$
and this defines the [[electron volt]], the amount of energy to move a single electron across an electric potential of $1 \text{ V}$

#### ... as a model of [[electronic configuration, and ionization]]
Using the technique that we [[use only the start and end state of a system]]. If [[air]] can be said to have a certain voltage, over which it undergoes an [[electronic configuration, and ionization|ionizing]] [[material phase change]] and it [[capacitive breakdown|turns into a conductor]] with a $V_\text{air max} \approx 3\times 10^6\text{ V/m}$ for a spherical [[Van de Graaff generator]] submerged in [[air]] then we find $$V_m=RE_m$$
Similar to the result that [[charge on a non-uniform body tends to accumulate more readily in portions with more curvature]] -- that the electric field is inversely proportional to the radius -- for a sphere.

When this is overcome the surrounding air forms a [[electrical voltage corona]]

#### ... represented with [[electric field lines]]
Similar to field lines we have [[equipotential surfaces]] this is related to calculus via [optimization with level curves](obsidian://open?vault=Calculus%20Review&file=Multivariable%20Calculus%2FProcesses%20-%20Algorithms%2FOptimization%20of%20functions%20of%20multiple%20variables) as well as [[tropographic]] maps, which leads to a proof that
