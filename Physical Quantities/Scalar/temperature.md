#C6-1 

A form of [[thermal energy]], it is a [[physical quantities|quantity]] measured in absolute temperature as [[kelvin]], as the average [[molecular speeds]] within a [[test volume]] for a [[material system]]. 

Many [[physical quantities|properties]] describing [[material]] depend on temperature. It is a part of the [[thermodynamic state]] of [[material system]].

Room temperature is around $20.0^\circ \text{C}$  ([[celsius]]).

#### ... macroscopic picture
Cold temperatures are smaller numbers, hot temperatures are larger numbers. A [[thermometer]] measures this form.

Consider that we are also generally discussing its measurement with the [[container]] [[at rest]]. That is no [[relative velocity]] between the [[thermometer]] and the [[material system]].

#### ... [[statistical mechanics|microscopic picture]]
This investigates 
- [[mass]], 
- [[molecular speeds]], 
- [[kinetic energy]], 
- [[momentum]] of 
- [[elementary entities]] ([[electrons]], [[atom]], [[molecule]])
- [[material system]].

Through the [[ideal gas law]], and [[thermodynamic state]] we develop these [[models]].
