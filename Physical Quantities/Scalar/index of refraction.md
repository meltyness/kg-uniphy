#C33-2 
Simply,$$n = {c \over v}$$
and following from [[magnetic properties of materials]], and [[dielectric, and dielectric strength]].

#### ... effect on [[speed of light]]
Due to [[Maxwell's laws]], light changes speed depending on the [[permeability]] and [[permittivity]] of the [[kind of material]] it is traveling through. It does so with the [[index of refraction]], $$\lambda = {\lambda_0 \over n}$$
#### ... and [[optical junction refractive dispersion]]
The speed of light in a [[material system]] depends on the [[kind of material]], since the index of refraction varies with the incident wavelength materials are described as having a dispersion relation. Additionally, systems with larger index of refraction tend to have higher dispersion.

#### ... [[table]] of common indices
#Warning these vary based on [[electromagnetic spectrum, frequency of light]] and values listed are for $\lambda_0 = 589 \text{ nm}$. #Plagiarism The variance with incident wavelength is called the [[optical junction refractive dispersion]].
