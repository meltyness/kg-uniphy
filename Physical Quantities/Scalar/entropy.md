A [[physical quantities]] that provides a [[scalar quantity|quantitative]] [[what can be measured|measure]] of [[order and disorder|disorder]].

Consider an [[isothermal]] [[thermodynamic process, path|process]], $$dQ = dW = p \ dV = {nRT \over V} \ dV \implies {dV \over V} \propto {dQ \over T}$$ Therefore, this [[heat flow through a finite temperature gradient is not reversible]], and $dV / V$ forms a metric for measuring the amount of disorder introduced. $$dS = {dQ \over T}$$
#### ...in a reversible process
For any [[reversibility|reversible]] [[thermodynamic process, path]] and pair of [[thermodynamic state]]
$$ \Delta S = \int_\text{State 1}^\text{State 2} {dQ \over T}$$
Since this quantity is path dependent, if $\text{S1} \rightarrow \text{S2}$ is not reversible, we can simply identify a path of reversible processes.

During any reversible, [[thermodynamic process, path#Cyclicality|cyclic]] process, which can be [[derivation|proven]] by adding up intersecting paths of small intersecting [[the Carnot cycle|carnot cycles]] [[hold on is this green's theorem whats going on here]]$$\int{dQ \over T} = 0 \ \ \ \ \ \ \text{(reversible cyclical process)}$$
#### ...for [[the Carnot cycle]]
[[the Carnot cycle]] exhibits zero entropy.

#### ...in non-reversible processes
The entropy change is the sum of the entropy change of participating [[material system]] within the [[thermodynamic systems]].

#### ...microscopic interpretation
When considering entropy as a measure of how much [[information measure paradox|information]] is given by a certain macroscopic description of the [[states]], we take $w$ the number of microscopic states, $k$ be the [[Boltzmann constant]], then $$S=k\ln w$$ is the entropy of a system.

Has units of $R/N_A$, $$ S\propto \bigg\{ {\text{J} \over \text{K molecules}} \bigg\}$$

For any system the most [[probability density|probable]] macroscopic state is the one with the greatest number of corresponding microscopic states, which is also the macroscopic state with the greatest disorder, and the greatest entropy.

[Trouton's rule - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trouton%27s_rule)

For a [[vaporizing]] event, most materials have $\Delta S \approx 10.5 R$
