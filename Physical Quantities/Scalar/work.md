### Definition
Work corresponds to the action of [[energy]] expended.

#### Applicable Laws
- [[work-energy theorem]]

### [[formula]]
#Caution Notice that work is written $W$ not $w$ 

In general for a [[force]] $\vec{F}$ and for a [[displacement]] $\vec{s}$ we have $$W = \vec{F}\cdot\vec{s} \ \ \text{(constant force, straight-line displacement)}$$
For a [[kinematics along a straight line#with Variable Acceleration|varying force in straight-line motion]], $$W = \int_{x_1}^{x_2} F_xdx \ \ \ \ \ \ \text{(force varying with distance, straight-line displacement)}$$
For a [[spring]] we write $F_x = kx$ and so the [[spring potential energy]] $$W = \int_{0}^{X} kxdx = [\frac{k}{2}x^2] \ \bigg|_{0}^{X}=\frac{k}{2}X^2$$
And finally for [[kinematics in space#acceleration in space|varying force in space]] we have that for a path $P$ from $P_1$ to $P_2$, the Work is given by the line integral: $$W=\int_{P_1}^{P_2}F\cos{\phi}dl=\int_{P_1}^{P_2}F_{||}dl=\int_P\vec{F}\cdot\vec{dl}$$
#### Total Work
[[the work done by the net force on a particle equals the change in the particle's kinetic energy]]

We add up the work done by each incident force through a bout.
