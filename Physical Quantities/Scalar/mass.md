A [[physical quantities]]
### Discussion of Units
The [[kilogram]] is defined to be the mass of a particular [[cylinder]] of [[platinum]]-[[iridium]] [[alloy]] kept near Paris.

### In terms of [[motion]]
Mass takes on a role as a quantification of the [[inertia]] of a given body.

Two bodies with $m_1, m_2$ are fastened together, then their mass is $m_1+m_2$.

However, since it is infeasible to count the number of [[protons]], [[electrons]], and [[neutrons]] in a body, this isn't a good way to define mass, however when discussing masses on those scales the [[atomic mass unit]] is used when dealing with [[material]]

### As a property of a [[material]]
Given a [[mass density]] and a [[volume]], a material will have a certain mass. Having [[rest mass]] is also the defining facet of [[material]], that [[a material particle has non-zero rest mass]].
