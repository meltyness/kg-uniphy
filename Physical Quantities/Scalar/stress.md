#C11-4 
#WaitWhat -- are there any [[elastic modulus]] under which stress is a [[vector quantity]]?
#GotIt 

#C11-E 11.93 demonstrates finding stress for skew cross-sections, skew [[force]] applied.

Depending on how the system is [[constraints|constrained]] there are three different types. #WaitWhat  is bulk stress a [[constraints|constraint]]?

- [[tensile-compressive stress]] from the [[tension force]]
- [[bulk stress]] from [[submersion]]
- [[shear stress]] as with [[cutting]]
