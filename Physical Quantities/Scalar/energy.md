#KeyConcept

#### Definition
A [[physical quantities]] for how to [[scalar quantity|quantify]] how [[rigid body|bodies]] within a [[mechanical system]] contain and [[Newton's third law of motion|exchange]] [[force]].

Over the course of some [[force|action]], the [[scalar quantity|amount]] of energy expended is quanitifed as [[work]]

At the time of development this was called the "living force."  #LanguageNote

#### Types of Energy
- [[kinetic energy]]
- [[thermal energy]]
- [[potential energy]]

#### Applicable Laws
[[law of conservation of energy]]
[[work-energy theorem]]
[[mass-energy equivalence]]

#### Specific Considerations
- A useful #SanityCheck note that this means for a force exerted in the opposite direction of motion that the work is negative.
- Who is *doing* the work? Remember [[Newton's third law of motion|each force on a body should be considered as an action from another]]
- Are you describing the work done by the [[superposition of forces|net force]] or the work done by each force applied?
- [[composite system|Composite systems]] raise special concerns with respect to [[externality]], principally that even though forces external transmit energy to a [[composite system]], the specific point may have no work done on it.
- Energy measurement is subject to [[relative velocity]].

#### Discussion of Units
The [[SI units]] are the [[joule]]
$\text{1 joule} = \text{(1 newton)(1 meter)}$

The [[Imperial]]
$\text{1 J} = \text{0.7376 ft · lb} \ \ \ \ \ \text{1 ft · lb} = \text{1.356 J}$

Named in honor of [[James Prescott Joule]]

#### Experimentation
The [Ball and clay experiment](http://www.eoht.info/page/Ball%20and%20clay%20experiment) [[experiment or measurement|demonstrates]] this.
