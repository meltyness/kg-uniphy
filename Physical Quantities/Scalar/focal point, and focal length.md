#C34-2 

For [[point object]] producing [[optical ray]] at a great distance, the incident rays are [[in parallel]] like a [[electromagnetic waves and light#as a plane wave step wave|plane wave]] the [[object distance]] is [[assume the maximum possible|like]] $s\rightarrow\infty$ and we can find the focal length of an [[optical lens]] by putting this into the [[object-image relationship]], and computing $s'$ as function of the design of lens to find where such rays converge.

For a [[parabolic mirror]] this is exactly true, for all parallel incident rays, but for a spherical mirror this is only true for rays close to the [[optical axis]]. As such, the [[object-image relationship]] is typically expressed in terms of the [[focal point, and focal length]], $f$.
