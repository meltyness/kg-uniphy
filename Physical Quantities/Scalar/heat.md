#C17-5

[[energy transformation and heat flow]] occurs between [[material system]] due to differences in [[temperature]].

Heat is a [[physical quantities|physical quantity]] proportional to the [[thermal energy]] transferred in this way.

Due to the influence of [[Antoine Lavoisier]], there is units of [[calorie]] and [[british thermal unit]], in addition to the [[joule]].

$$ 1 \text{ cal} = 4.186 \text{ J}, \ \ \ \ 1 \text{ Btu = 1055 J} $$


#### [[Joule-Thomson Effect]] 
Putting [[work]] into a [[fluid]] or [[gas]], in a simple situation we have the [[formula]], $$Q = mc\Delta T$$
Where $c$ is the [[heat capacity and specific heat]]

#### [[latent heat]]
For a given [[kind of material]] and [[thermodynamic state]], this is simply $$Q=\pm mL$$

#### [[law of conservation of energy]]
For two [[material system]] undergoing [[energy transformation and heat flow]] leads to a useful value called [[heat current]] $$\text{heat in} = \text{heat out}$$
#### [[thermal conduction]]
When in [[thermal contact, material system junction, optical junction or adventure|thermal contact]] we can use this figure to compute the rate.
