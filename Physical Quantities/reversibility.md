#C20-1 

A [[logical]] statement and [[physical quantities]] to the positive or negative, regarding whether or not a [[thermodynamic process, path]] can be expected to occur in reverse.

Natural processes are irreversible, such as 
- [[heat flows so that thermal energy goes only from hot to cold]]
- any [[dissipative force]] acting
- [[material mixture]]
- [[free expansion]]

Or stated differently, it is [[impossible]] to [[experiment or measurement|observe]] certain things happen in reverse.

We set [[temperature gradient]] to some systems to be very small say $\partial T / \partial x$ and then can describe a system changing reversibly in nearly [[thermal equilibrium]] a phenomena called [[thermal quasiequilibrium]], undergone by most [[adiabatic]] processes.
