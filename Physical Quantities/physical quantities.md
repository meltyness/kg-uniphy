### Definition
Any number used to describe a [[phenomena of nature]] quantitatively.

One such class can only be defined in terms of [[design experiments|how they are measured]] these are called [[operational definition of physical quantities]], and we always wind up with [[precision, accuracy, uncertainty, and significant figures]].

They are always taken with respect to some [[standard systems of units]]

Consider also [[derived quantities]] where we measure and use a [[formula]] to [[making predictions with physics|make predictions]] or to [[estimate]].

Some are described with simply a [[scalar quantity]] and others require [[vector quantity]]

Some such quantities are considered [[conservation|conserved]].

' - indicates that this quantity has a physically sensible time derivative not otherwise listed.

#WaitWhat what if we go through the process of generating a sparse matrix as to which of these has a reasonable derivative with respect to the other?
