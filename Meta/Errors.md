 In #C1-3 the description of the superseded length definition seems to be incomplete.
In #C1-5 units are dropped from the demonstration of parenthetical uncertainty.
In #C3-5 "Relative Velocity in Two or Three Dimensions" there's a pretty glaring typographical error.
In #C4-1 [[tension force]] is given as acting on one body, but in 4.43, $T$ is treated as being a property of the rope, like [[torque]].

In #C4-6 challenge problem #1, we are asked to *derive* a relationship from given laws, principles, and a specific physical situation. It isn't made explicit before this point what a such a [[derivation]]

~~Int #C6-4 Question 6.17, they forgot that the box has mass, must be expressed either $w=mg$.~~

#C6-E -- 6.59, "force with *magnitude* equal to..."

#C6-E -- 6.65, problem doesn't specify whether any energy exists at $x_2$ best can be said is that $W_h > {k \over x_1} - {k \over x_2}$.

#C7-1 -- "Living force" would have been a useful historical note.

#C8-2 -- Equation 8.11 missing arrow over $\vec{0}$.

#C8-6 -- It's not really an error, but I wish that the 'priming notation' introduced in the derivation of Thrust were introduced earlier, during the kinematic equations discussion --r or possibly in a challenge problem pertaining to those.

#C8-E -- Question 8.63 -- ignore air resistance?

~~#C9-4 -- A [[rigid body]] can be thought of as being composed of [[motion|moving]], [[mass|massive]] [[particle|elements]], and its [[kinetic energy]] based on the [[law of conservation of energy]] corresponds to the sum of the energy [[isolated system|of its components]]. -- the principles are there but the book may not make this principle completely explicit with its definition of Rigid Body~~ they totally do, haha

I'm frustrated with the fact that it is not clear throughout the discussions when we are to understand that a physical quantity has an operational definition, rather than

#C10-3 Are we talking about radial symmetry? Does the body need to be vase-like for this to apply?

#C10-E Exercise 10.33 the 84m/s 400lb box in the room -- jesus christ!

#C10-E Exercise 10.43 parachutist onto a turntable -- the solutions manual doesn't make it perfectly clear why there was work done -- that is the center of mass of the joint system changed. Nor does it draw attention to the fact that this constitutes an inelastic collision

#C11-4 Materials not well-defined, starting from science

#C11-E ~~Possible error in the solutions manual, 11.13(b). The tension force taken is off by a factor of two, due to the bizarre geometric relationship used obfuscating the issue. A clear sign of this is the appearance of a Trig angle difference-formula in the application of Newton's First Law for Torques, which simplifies to $T\sin(15^\circ)$ rather than $2T\sin(15^\circ)$.~~ It was me, but this still sucks.

#C11-E Since 11.31 is a weight the answer should be in Newtons, not Pascals

#C12-E 11.72 suddenly introduces "Mechanical Energy", terminology not used elsewhere -- it was introduced as "Total Mechanical Energy." Also, it looks like they've used find-and-replace to make this from a calculus problem to a non-calculus problem ... haha what?!

~~#C13-E 13.71 the solution for this appears to abuse the [[parallel-axis theorem]], because the axis a distance $L/2$ from the top two sticks can't have the same [[moment of inertia]] as the axis a distance $L/2$ from the bottom two sticks. A simpler solution is to use $\sum mr^2$ and follow a path find that the [[center of mass]] of the bottom sticks is a distance ${\sqrt{5} \over 2}L$ from the axis of rotation.~~ it was me! ☹

~~#C14-4 How does a flow line differ from a streamline?~~ next paragraph

#C14-E 14.21 the answer is incorrect because it disregards the stated pressure inside the vessel of 1atm, only the pressure difference contributes to the $F_\perp$.

#C14-E Appears to conclude without nary a mention of [[fan]], [[turbine]], nor [[water wheel]]

#C15-1 "x ray" not "x-ray"

#C15-4 makes an ugly, and poorly motivated claim about the situation at individual elements along a string. While I agree that the slope at either end of a short displacement of string is the same, 

#C14-E 14.84, regarding the production of a [[parabolic mirror]] seems to arrive at expression $\partial p / \partial r = \rho \omega^2 r$ through [[circular logic]]. I can only derive ${\partial p \over \partial r} = \rho \omega^2 r/2$, by writing down $p=dF_\perp/dA$ and computing the hierarchy of differential relationships over a wedge of substance onto a curved wall of further substance, and taking the partial wrt $r$. Question should probably also stipulate that viscocity is non-zero, otherwise the fluid could never end up in this steady-state of rotation.

#C15-E 15.57, 4 is drawn such that it could be a cusp.

#C17-7 Early in the chapter a system is described to accurately measure [[heat capacity and specific heat]] using a [[heating coil]], the three classes of [[energy transformation and heat flow]] don't identify a sufficient class to explain how such a coil would work.

#C18-1 Introduction uses the more specific "molecule" rather than more general "elementary entities"

#C18-1 Argument seems to be contingent on mass conservation, or some other such principle.

~~#C18-1 States that $a$ in the van der Waals equation gas law is an effect of attraction between the molecules -- however it increases pressure, so it must correspond to an effect of repulsion.~~

#C18-2 "The average kinetic energy of a molecule" -- what does that mean?

#C18-3 It actually wasn't explicitly assumed that the molecules were uniformly distributed N/V, this is introduced as a spurious assumption in the middle of the argument

#C18-4 This is actually the first time $C_V$ is mentioned, or that these were defined [[isochorically]] (except for the description of the gas experimental setup)

#C18-4 Are interatomic forces the same as intermolecular forces?

#C18-5 18.31 RMS in terms of expectation value is confusing

#C18-6 What happened to italics? [[at any pressure less than the triple point pressure, no liquid phase is possible]] Am I reading the word of Jesus? 

... oh I #GotIt it's an [[earth, atmosphere, water, and wildlife|iceberg]] ...

...... oh... now I really #GotIt ... [[The Lennard-Jones Potential]] ......

#C18-E 18.7 used the wrong pressure.

#C19-7 on [[ratio of heat capacities]] doesn't call-back the relationship to [[dynamics of a sound wave]]

#C19-E 19.3 is bipolar based on the phrasing of the question.

#C20-E 20.48 uses $P$ for pressure, convention has been $p$

#C22-E 22.33 it depends on x but it doesnt depend on x

#C23-4 Equipotential conductor proof of electrostatic cavity voltage mentions the result regarding electrostatic surface charge without explicitly mentioning the need to do so arises from charge conservation as the central assumption.

#C23-E 23.12 their speed relative to one another should be used to find the kinetic energy, right?

#C25-5 "Power Input to a Source" what theveryis going on here.

#C14-1 [[mass density]] spells [[glycerin]] differently from elswhere OOPS COPYEDITING HEHE

#C27-1 Øersted is spelled wrong.

#C27-7 $\mu$ depicted as a vector, but not written as a vector in 27.24

#C27-7 inconsistent use of "-" in x-ray [[electromagnetic spectrum, frequency of light]].

#C27-7 Is figure 27.36 wrong? My application of right-hand-rule doesn't align? Book appears to have used the left-hand-rule to find the magnetic moment, and used $U$ to arrive at the wrong results.

#C27-8 enamelled wire separates the turns.

#C27-E 27.29 doesn't specify enough to choose a direction.

#C27-E I thought 27.86 wanted me to do (a) without knowing the radius

#C28-8 All *familiar* matter

#C28-E 28.31 answer uses $m_0$ instead of $\mu_0$

#C29-2 There's an unnumbered figure between 29.12 and 29.13

#C32-4 does this not follow from mass-energy equivalence?

#C33-2 wavefront was actually introduced in section #C15-5 #WaitWhat  
> h e  n e v e r  s a i d  w a v e f r o n t

#C34-1 why introduce magnification when there can't be any?

#C35-5 35.19 is a difference principle written as a static relationship for some reason.

#C39-4 "Geometric optics is valid whenever interference and diffraction effects can be neglected" #WaitWhat this might be wrong for instances where scattering can occur.
