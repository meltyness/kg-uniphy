time-adjusted, from 25m to 35m or 45m pomodoros.

Ok, I'll level with you we've basically completely blown off chapters:
29-37 we'll take a closer look at those exercises, but I'm pretty sure it's OK just need to come to grips with how to remember the important results.

#### Big brain blocks
- [ ] how did the loopty calcuulus thing go agian lol
	- [ ] we skipped those or they were trivial, haha but its the same idea as greens theorem if you can figure out how to write a problem down
	- [ ] maybe let's do one numerically!
- [ ] We'll just pretend the test date is Oct 19, haha oops :)
- [ ] De-novo [[dilation and contraction]] dream
- [ ] Where did I see the word "upright"? What are you, a dentist?

#### 34 exercise planning
Work
- [x] 34.66
- [x] 34.75, 34.76, 34.77
- [ ] 34.116
