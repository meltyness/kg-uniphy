### Discussion
When listing [[physical quantities]] as the result of a [[experiment or measurement|measurement]], you should list the digits down to the smallest gradation provided by the [[measurement device]].

### Uncertainty
Uncertainty is taken to a physical quantity by writing, for example, $$56.47 \pm 0.02\text{mm}$$ or, for short, $$56.47(02) \ \text{mm}$$
we can also use [[percent error]] and fractional error, like $$47 \text{ ohms }\pm 10\%$$
### Significant Figures
Sometimes uncertainty is not stated explicitly, but indicated by the number of meaningful digits, so the uncertainty is assumed based on the place-value of the smallest part of the quantity. $$2.91\text{ mm} \implies 2.91 \pm 0.01\text{ mm} $$
A key aspect to representing [[physical quantities]] is also [[scientific notation]]

### Under arithmetic
- With multiplication and division, the number of significant figures is the same as the number with the fewest.
- With addition and subtraction, the largest uncertainty determines the number of significant figures.

When computing [[derived quantities]], round, and maintain only as many significant figures as the lowest-quality measurement.
