#C34-1 
A kind of [[dilation and contraction]] of an [[extended object]] by a [[thermal contact, material system junction, optical junction or adventure|optical junction]], [[optical lens]] or [[optical mirror]]

#### Lateral magnification
In a single dimension for an [[extended object]], $$m = {y' \over y}$$
If $m > 0$ this magnification leaves the object [[optically erect]], if $m<0$ the object is [[optically inverted]]. Additionally in terms of the [[paraxial approximation for a spherical mirror]], $$m = {f \over (s-f)}$$

#### Angular magnification
For a [[magnifying glass]] with the [[virtual image]] distant from the observer, we must consider the [[angular size]] $$M={\theta' \over \theta}$$

#### Longitudinal magnification
#C34-E 

For a small object, it has longitudinal dimension magnificatiton with (corresponding to the [[optically reversed]] direction / [[dilation and contraction]] of the [[object distance]] parameter, $$m' = {ds' \over ds}$$
