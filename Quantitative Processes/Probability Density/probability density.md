#C18-5

A type of [[physical quantities]] that is a [[function]] which may arise in [[statistical mechanics]] akin to a [[vector quantity]] or [[scalar quantity]]. Transforms simply to a [[cumulative distribution function]], and a [[complementary cumulative distribution function]].

It is used where [[results]] are only known to have [[making predictions with physics|significance]] across multiple [[experiment or measurement|experiments or measurements]].

- The [[formula]] may be read "Within any population of molecules, $N$ we have an [[frequency of occurence]] of $v$ with $f(v)$" $$f(v)dv = {1\over N}dN $$
- Concretely, the probability than any molecule will have speed in the interval $[v, v+dv]$ is $f(v)dv$
- The [[expectation value]] of speed is $$E[v] = \int_0^\infty vf(v)dv$$
- The [[root-mean square]] is $$v_\text{rms}=\sqrt{E[v^2]}=\sqrt{\int_0^\infty v^2f(v)dv}$$
