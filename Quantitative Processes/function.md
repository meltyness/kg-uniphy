Completely intuitively, most types of [[relationships]] are functions where $$f(\text{input}) = \text{output}$$
They can operate on things like
- [[path]]
- [[scalar quantity]]
- [[vector quantity]]

And they can be operated on with
- [[weighted sum]]

A [[tropographic]] mapping is a type of function.
