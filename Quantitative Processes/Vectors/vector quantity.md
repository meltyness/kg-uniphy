### Discussion
A [[representation]] of a [[physical quantities]] which includes a direction and a magnitude.

Represented like $\vec{A}$

Can be considered as an [[aggregation]] of [[scalar quantity|scalars]].

### Operations
#### Vector sum 
[[two vectors can be added]]
$\vec{C} = \vec{A} + \vec{B}$, parallelogram rule for addition, $\vec{C}$ is the resultant
	- Additive commutativity $\vec{A} + \vec{B} = \vec{B} + \vec{A}$

#### Magnitude
[[a vector is composed of a magnitude and a direction which can be extracted, written as components]]
$\text{ of } \vec{A} = | \vec{A} | = \sqrt{A_x^2+A_y^2}$

#### Scalar product 
$c\vec{A} = <cA_x, cA_y, cA_z>$

#### Dot product 
[[there exists a vector dot product for relating two vectors, their angles, and magnitudes]]
- $\vec{A}\cdot\vec{B}=AB\cos{\phi}=|\vec{A}||\vec{B}|\cos{\phi}=A_xB_x+A_yB_y+A_zC_z$
	- The preferred definition involves the [[scalar quantity|scalar magnitudes]].

#### Vector Product / Cross Product
[[there exists a vector cross product relating three vectors]]
- $|\vec{A} \times \vec{B}| = AB\sin\phi$
- $\vec{A} \times \vec{B} = -\vec{B} \times \vec{A}$
[[right-hand rule]]

#### Component isolation
- $A_x = |\vec{A}|\cos(\theta)$
- $A_y = |\vec{A}|\sin(\theta)$

#### Direction isolation
 $\tan(\theta) = {A_y \over A_x}$

### Properties
- vectors are parallel if they have the same direction
- vectors are equal if they have the same components
- if $\vec{A} = -\vec{B}$ these vectors are antiparallel
- Unit vectors have $| \vec{u} | = 1$, can be obtained by dividing a vector by its magnitude
	- Consider also $\hat{i} = <1,0,0>$, $\hat{j} = <0,1,0>$, $\hat{k}=<0,0,1>$.



### Examples
- [[displacement]]
- [[velocity]]
- [[force]]
- [[momentum]]
