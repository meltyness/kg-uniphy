For a [[physical quantities]] that is a [[function]] of [[time]], $y=f(t)$ the instantaneous version is defined, 

#### [[phenomenology]]
- By simple [[experiment or measurement]], typically a change can be measured by taking two measurements at two [[time]] [[instant]], and computing an [[average]].

$${dy(t) \over dt}=f'(t)=\lim_{h\rightarrow0}{f(t-h)-f(t)\over h}$$
