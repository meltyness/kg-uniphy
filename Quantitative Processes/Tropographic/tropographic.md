### Discussion
A [[representation]] of a [[physical quantities]] where the [[physical quantities]] vary along each axis. Similar to a [[function]]

#### This results in techniques like
- [[form an equitropic joint-union]]
- [[form an isotropic measurement]]
- [[form an isostable measurement]]

#### Some examples
- [[wave equation]]
- [[equation of thermodynamic state]]
- [[partial differential equations]]
